# contrary view on happiness

Happiness is such an elusive concept. To chase after happiness is to chase a ghost. 

## Conditional happiness 
Conditional happiness is saying - "I'll be happy when X happens". It's happiness based on conditions, forever hoping that circumstances will be according to what you want them to be. But this is an error, circumstances are often not what you want them to be. Conditional happiness will never work. Don't get attached to happiness. Men seek selective quiet - they want peace when there's turmoil, but are okay with chaos when they are happy.  

## Works best as a byproduct
Happiness is overrated. Chasing it directly is of no use. It works best as a byproduct of cultivating other qualities like mastery or empathy or awareness.  

## I've had enough
The pleasure-pain cycle has made me run enough circles. The goal is to become immune to whatever life throws at me. There are much better things to optimise - the moment-to-moment experience is one.  
Happiness is overrated. I've nothing to do with it.
