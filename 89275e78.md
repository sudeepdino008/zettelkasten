# Coroutines

Couroutines is a concurrency design pattern.  
A couroutine is an instance of suspendable computation. It's similar to thread, but the execution is not bound to a thread. It may suspend execution in one thread, and resume on another. In this sense they are light-weight threads.

- DO NOT BLOCK THE MAIN THREAD
the main thread has to update the screen every 16ms or more, which is about 60fps. More than this and the UI can freeze and even give ANR for longer operations.

## Skeleton
- where to execute? - dispatchers
- things needed for lifecycle management and error propagation/recovery? - job, coroutine scope
- how to create them? - scope builders and coroutine builders


## remaining stuff to cover
- android support for coroutines - [Use Kotlin coroutines with Architecture components
](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines#lifecyclescope)
- error propagation


## Funda
### Structured Concurrency
- new coroutines can only be launched in a CoroutineScope, this helps in delimiting the lifetime of a coroutine and makes sure it doesn't leak.
- An outer scope doesn't complete unless all the inner ones are done.
- structured concurrency also ensures that all the errors are properly handled and never lost.

## Inheritance
[children of a coroutine](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutine-context-and-dispatchers.html#children-of-a-coroutine)
- a parent coroutine always waits for completion of all its children. It doesn't have to explicitly track all the children it launches, and doesn't have to do **Job.join()** to wait for them at the end.

## Coroutines are light-weight
- how does it achieve suspending the thread?


## CoroutineScope
- all coroutines run inside a CoroutineScope. It controls the lifetime of couroutines present inside it, meaning that if the job associated with the CoroutineScope is cancelled, the associated coroutines are cancelled too. 
- It also allows to specify dispatchers (like main, IO) which controls the thread in which the coroutines run.
- viewModelScope: an extension function to ViewModel. The scope is bound to **Dispatchers.Main** and will automatically be cancelled when the **ViewModel** is cleared.  
use **launch** when you don't have a result to return, use async when you do.

### Scope builder
- **runBlocking** is a scope builder which bridges the non-coroutine world and one with couroutines. It blocks the builder thread till it completes and is a non-suspending function.
- **coroutineScope** is similar to runBlocking, the difference is that it'a a suspending function and doesn't block the builder thread.
- a non-suspend (and common) way to create scopes would be then to use **CoroutineScope** constructor - `CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO)`

## CouroutineContext
- set of various elements. A couroutine executes in some context.
- the main elements are Dispatchers and Job.
- At implementation level, CoroutineScope contains a single field of type CoroutineContext (with job and dispatcher)

### Dispatcher
- represented by **CoroutineDispatcher**. It's a type of **CoroutineContext**
- 3 main dispatchers: Main, IO (optimised for IO and network), Default (for cpu intensive operations)

- when should custom dispatchers be created?

### Job
- It's a handle to the launched coroutine. It's returned by the coroutine builders like launch and async.

## Coroutine builders
- launch, async, withContext etc. are coroutine builders.
- They accept an optional CouroutineContext, otherwise it's inherited from the couroutine scope it is being launched from.
- **withContext** can be used to switch to another dispatcher. It's useful when you have to return a value from a suspend function or coroutine scope.
```kotlin
return withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
  val result = try {
    network.fetchNextTitle().execute()
  } catch (cause: Throwable) {
    throw TitleRefreshError("Unable to refresh title", cause)
  }

  if (result.isSuccessful) {
    titleDao.insertTitle(Title(result.body()!!))
    return "success"
  } else {
    throw TitleRefreshError("unable to refresh title", null)
  }
}

```

## suspend
```kotlin
// Slow request with coroutines
@UiThread
suspend fun makeNetworkRequest() {
    // slowFetch is another suspend function so instead of 
    // blocking the main thread  makeNetworkRequest will `suspend` until the result is 
    // ready
    val result = slowFetch()
    // continue to execute after the result is ready
    show(result)
}

// slowFetch is main-safe using coroutines
suspend fun slowFetch(): SlowResult { ... }
```
- **suspend** keyword doesn't specify the thread code runs on. Those may run on a background or main thread.
- **suspend** functions can only be called from other suspend functions or from inside a coroutine scope.
- the key advantage is that the code becomes sequential, rather than callbacks based (which is harder to read and reason about)
- how is suspend function implemented?? Is it internally translated to a coroutine builder.

## [debugging](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutine-context-and-dispatchers.html#debugging-coroutines-and-threads)

```kotlin
println("My job is ${coroutineContext[Job]}")

in debug mode, it outputs something like:
My job is "coroutine#1":BlockingCoroutine{Active}@6d311334

```

name the coroutines for debbuging:
```kotlin
val v1 = async(CoroutineName("v1coroutine")) {
    delay(500)
    log("Computing v1")
    252
}
```
