# What to read


## Broad vs Specific

- When exploring a new field, you can pursue two kinds of information - broad and specific.
- Initially, it's important to get an eagle eye's view of the landscape - the conflicting thoughts, nuances and a broader view of the field. 
- Reading a specific book early on is dangerous as it might lock your vision to that lens.
- Broader reading also helps in asking better questions and critique the specific texts you might read later.


## Keep you fundamentals strong

- Rather than memorizing advanced stuff, seek to have strong fundamentals.
- Fundamentals are applicable much more widely, and the dynamic advanced stuff can be derived from them.
- One way to do this is, for example, read Karl Marx if you're interested in communism, and Darwin if you wanna read about evolution.
- Fundamental texts are usually more intuitive and closer to grassroot level. The later texts are interpretations and abstracted out.


## Beware too much meta

- are you reading too much about reading? 
- Or are you reading about startups (Without even minutely starting something)?
- Or are you reading about mindfulness without practicing it in daily life.

Be much much much more interested in doing things, and forming lenses from which to see the world. Meta is great, and it's needed. But a lot of books coming out are meta, beware the hard intellectual husk which creates a illusion of work.  
Read things that bends your mind, don't read about stuff which tell you to read things which bends your mind.
