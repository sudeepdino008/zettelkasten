# What to read


## Broad vs Specific

- When exploring a new field, you can pursue two kinds of information - broad and specific.
- Initially, it's important to get an eagle eye's view of the landscape - the conflicting thoughts, nuances and a broader view of the field. 
- Reading a specific book early on is dangerous as it might lock your vision to that lens.
- Broader reading also helps in asking better questions and critique the specific texts you might read later.


## Keep you fundamentals strong

- Rather than memorizing advanced stuff, seek to have strong fundamentals.
- Fundamentals are applicable much more widely, and the dynamic advanced stuff can be derived from them.
- One way to do this is, for example, read Karl Marx if you're interested in communism, and Darwin if you wanna read about evolution.
- Fundamental texts are usually more intuitive and closer to grassroot level. The later texts are interpretations and abstracted out.
