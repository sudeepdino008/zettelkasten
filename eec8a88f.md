# Cool Tools

1. **[Observable HQ](https://observablehq.com/)**  
A social media for visualized data.  
e.g.: [d3 magic](https://observablehq.com/@d3) and [random tree](https://observablehq.com/@d3/random-tree?collection=@d3/d3-hierarchy)

2. **[Pandadoc filter](https://github.com/hertogp/imagine)**  
To process markdown codeblocks into images or ascii art  
Neuron needs to support this in its site generation. See [github issue](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/363) 

3. **[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)**  
Hand drawn images (almost xkcd like), with a cool option to "copy to clipboard as png/svg"

4. **[DiffChecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/)** \
Check diffs between texts/images/pdfs/excel/folders. \
Also has a CLI version.

5. **[Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/)** \
Record and share your terminal sessions (the right way). Forget screen recording apps and  blurry video. \
Allows the viewer to copy paste the command as well (it's all text) \
Allows easy embedding in your blog post. \
Use `asciinema rec` to start recording
