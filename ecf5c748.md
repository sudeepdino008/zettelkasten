## Notes

- Code coverage: Enable from 'Edit Scheme' in xcode.
- Test-driven document: write a failing test, then you fix and make it pass, then refactor if you can: Red, green, refactor cycle
- asynchronous unit tests - XCTestExpectations

## Test types
- Unit tests
- Integration tests - testing of different units integrate together. We use real (as opposed to mock) responses here. Focus on small number of modules and focus on their integration.
- UI tests: interactions with different pieces of the app (using mock data)
- E2E tests: simulate the entire users journey of the app (using real data)

Typically, 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests and 10% end-to-end tests are recommended (UI tests can be plugged with integration tests). The key is to maintain a pyramid structure.

## UI testing:
1. UI unit test bundle target
2. record; do interactions with app
3. [XCUIElementTypeQueryProvider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementtypequeryprovider) - provides ready made queries to locate children UI elements (buttons, navigation bars etc.)  
You can also use `descendants(matching:)` to locate a corresponding element type (`accessibilityIdentifier` should be set).
4. Mocking (protocols, protocols, everywhere! :( )

## iOS Snapshot test cases
Facebook library using which you can write ui tests. It compares snapshots with reference images and fails/passes depending on if it matches.  
It also allows to snapshot compare subviews.

## Quick and Nimble
- descriptive unit tests
- behavior driven development
- meant as a replacement of XCTests: which don't have enough macros (for example, to assert substrings or if array contains); Additionally, it's hard to write asynchronous tests in XCTests.
