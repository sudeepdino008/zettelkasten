# iOS Testing

#### resources
- [Unit tests and UI testing](https://www.raywenderlich.com/8458722-testing-in-ios)
- [Behavior Driven Development (BDD)](https://www.raywenderlich.com/5042-testing-using-a-bdd-framework)

## Notes

- Code coverage: Enable from 'Edit Scheme' in xcode.
- Test-driven document: write a failing test, then you fix and make it pass, then refactor if you can: Red, green, refactor cycle
- asynchronous unit tests - XCTestExpectations

## UI testing:
1. UI unit test bundle target
2. record; do interactions with app
3. [XCUIElementTypeQueryProvider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementtypequeryprovider) - provides ready made queries to locate children UI elements (buttons, nav bars etc.)  
You can also use `descendants(matching:)` to locate a corresponding element type (`accessibilityIdentifier` should be set).
4. Mocking (protocols, protocols, everywhere! :( )

## iOS Snapshot test cases
Facebook library using which you can write ui tests. It compares snapshots with reference images and fails/passes depending on if it matches.  
It also allows to snapshot compare subviews.

## Quick and Nimble
- descriptive unit tests
- behaviour driven development
- meant as a relacement of XCTests: which don't have enough macros (for example, to assert substrings or if array contains); Additionally, it's hard to write asynchronous tests in XCTests.
