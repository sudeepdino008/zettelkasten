# Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution

In 1950s, IBM introduced the IBM 704 which was regarded as "pretty much the only computer that could handle complex math." It was the Hulking Giant, cost several millions of dollars, took up an entire room and needed constant care of professional operators. The only people allowed to operate it (feed programs) were holy priests (collectively called Priesthood). The people who submitted their programs to the priests were the official acolytes. It was ritualistic. Closed and Controlled.  
By some turn of events, MIT acquired the TX-0, which didn't need you to punch cards to feed your programs (which was needed in 704, making it a tedious affair). It was also more "interactive", allowing users to edit the program while sitting at the computer.  
This ushered in an era of first-generation hackers who programmed tools, and tools to create tools, editors, debuggers and serious code golfing. It was the first time a group of inquisitive students laid hands on a free-to-use machine, and the result was a explosion of frantic all-night hacking, creating programs which were freely shared and improved upon. These were people who lived and breathed code, wild and pure hackerism. Some folks like Richard Greenblatt torched their academic careers because hacking was too much fun.  
It was a time when people hacked code just for the sake of it, feeling the power to control a universe inside the box. Commercialism didn't yet concern itself with this craftsmanship--an era I can imagine, but not identify with.
The next part of the books deals with the hardware hacking, which comes about when 3 engineers in a company called Intel invent a chip called microprocessor: a processor which incorporates the functions of a CPU on a single IC. This leads to another key breakthrough - The Personal Computer in the 1970s.  
The Homebrew Computer Club (roughly, a meetup for hardware hackers) and its most famous visitors - Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Steve Wozniak; The influence of these giants in the domain of personal computers was interesting (to say the least). The conflict between pure hackerism and selling computer programs start becoming visible here, as Bill Gates sends his famous "Open Letter to Hobbyists".  
The above schism completely splits off as the third-generation hackers came about, programming computer games and becoming ultra-rich. The story wounding up with the onset of professional management and a tighter reign over the reluctant game hackers.

It's fascinating how important the free flow of ideas and sharing was to the computer revolution. I wonder if the computer world would be as rich as it is today if computers and softwares got commercialized too early. The hackers mentioned in the book are rightly dubbed heroes who played their roles in liberating the computer to the masses.
