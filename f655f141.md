# "Should" is not accurate
- There's listless guilt (which is vague guilt that you should do something, but not sure exactly what) vs pointed guilts (Where you feel guilty about doing/being something in particular).
- "Should" is a common source of pointed guilts.

Imagine a person who wakes up feeling sick. They might say to themselves, "Ugh. I should go to the pharmacy now to pick medications". There are two things that can happen now - you go to the pharmacy, feeling bitter and resentful, and pick the medications OR you skip that, and feel terrible for the rest of the day.  
This kind of statement disconnects the task from the purpose. Imagine if the person said - "ugh, if I went to the pharmacy to pick up medications, I might feel better at work today". This **keeps the task tethered to the purpose**, and there's no inclusion of unnecessary guilt here. It's a simple tradeoff, "incur the social/time costs of buying meds" vs "incur the physical/mental costs of feeling ill."

Don't say "I should really finish my paper", instead say - "If I don't finish my paper, my grades will be poor, teachers would frown, parents would shout". It helps you generate clear options. Then weigh. And then choose.

Unpacking a should also exposes people's imagination to failure scenarios, which is difficult. However this kind of imagination can help you maintain a level-hand when things turn sour for you.

## It's not a silver bullet, but it's still a bullet
This doesn't make it easy - you might still be at conflict with yourself about the different (albeit clear) options. You might prefer the option-1, but your visceral emotions might still end up pushing you to option-2.  

## beware fake unpackings of "should"
 "I should finish this paper" might be translated to "I need to finish this paper" or the a translation from advice columns - "I *get to* finish this paper."  
 These translations still don't connect the task to your goals and purposes, it doesn't expose the tradeoffs.
 
## Why this works?
With a "should", the choices either make you good, or they make you bad. With a proper translation, your choices are accurately exposed, such that you can see how much they make you move towards a desired goal.  

## Leave the should for historians
"Should" should be used only retrospectively. When you're facing a decision, you should be weighing all the options and try to find the best option. When you do something because you "should", it's often coming from an obligation - moral, social. Consider if you want to do some charity out of a sense of "should" - your friends are doing it, and you've to be silent when they are recounting their instances of altruism. It leads to altruism driven by guilt; People become conflicted, and then resentful, and then might even leave charity.  
Instead of that, imagine if they don't force themselves, and drop the "should". They might feel relieved when they realize that they didn't actually care people (and go have icecream). It's much more probable that they would feel a little hollow, concerned that if they didn't check themselves, they'd never do anything to help the less fortunate. That might be unacceptable to them.  
Quit the "should". Then a part of you might say - "but will I ever get around doing it?" and then listen and engage with this part. Never forcing yourself and becoming an altruist if and only if you want to help,.
