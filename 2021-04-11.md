## ethereum
proof of work - basically keeps track of who owns the coins 
proof of stake - an alternative to "proof of work" where the weight of a single node in the consensus voting process is proportional to the currency holdings rather than computing power.

Essentially, each transaction in the block must provide a valid state transition from what was the canonical state before the transaction was executed to some new state. Note that the state is not encoded in the block in any way; it is purely an abstraction to be remembered by the validating node and can only be (securely) computed for any block by starting from the genesis state and sequentially applying every transaction in every block.

The one validity condition present in the above list that is not found in other systems is the requirement for "proof of work". The precise condition is that the double-SHA256 hash of every block, treated as a 256-bit number, must be less than a dynamically adjusted target, which as of the time of this writing is approximately 2187. The purpose of this is to make block creation computationally "hard", thereby preventing sybil attackers from remaking the entire blockchain in their favor.

how are merkel trees exactly used?

in general, there are two approaches toward building a consensus protocol: building an independent network, and building a protocol on top of Bitcoin. (pros and cons of each is discussed) 

Another way to build advances applications on top of cryptocurrency is to use the basic scripting support that bitcoing provides (yup, it does). However it has various limitations. Ethereum seeks to alleviate those limitations and provides a language/platform to write scripts.

The intent of Ethereum is to create an alternative protocol for building decentralized applications, providing a different set of tradeoffs that we believe will be very useful for a large class of decentralized applications, with particular emphasis on situations where rapid development time, security for small and rarely used applications, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently interact, are important. Ethereum does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions. 

Ethereum principles:
- Accounts: the state is made up of objects called "accounts". State transition is the direct transfers of value and info between accounts  
externally owned accounts and contract accounts (execute constracts (or code) when receiving a messsage)
- Transaction: signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account.
"gas" is the fundamental unit of computation in ethereum. It's crucial for Entereum's anti-denial of service model. For every computation, bandwidth and storage that someone consumes, they must pay proprtionally. This prevents denial of service attacks.
- Messages: contracts have the ability to send messages to other contracts. These are virtual objects and never serialized.

- Code execution: Ethereum virtual machine code (EVM); three places to store data - stack/memory/contract's long-term storage



## Digital currency

**The problem with fiat:** might not be as relevant in first world countries with relatively stable economies, but specially crucial for countries like Argentina or Venezuela, where governments have heavily manipulated its money.  
**Fiat money loses its value with time.** The reason is simple: government likes to spend more than what it earns through  taxes and other income sources. It does this by printing extra money and putting it in circulation, thereby decreasing the value of unit fiat currency.  
Bitcoins are valuable because only a limited supply ever would be released and the date when the last one would be released is approximately known.  
The **intrinsic value** of bitcoin is that it's free from a central authority and not subjected to inflation.
