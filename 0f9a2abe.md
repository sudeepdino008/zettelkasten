# trust the system


- First is consistency, do you have a system which repeated day in and day out (or atleast frequently enough will allow you to succeed?). 
- It might seem that progress is too slow or that there is no progress - But you have to place you trust on the system, and continue chipping away even when it seems you've hit a plateau. It's easy to want to overhaul your habits or systems - Don't fall for that! Evaluate the system - Yes, but don't start redesigning things evertime you are frustrated.
- With the "trust the system" emphasised, it's also important to evaluate the system and see if it has the important elements.
