# Stock Options 

## What
- Stocks are given by companies to their employees, as a way to incentivize them to skyrocket the company and increase its valuation.
- A new pool of company shares is issues (typically at an investment round), and a percentage of it is reserved for employees.
- Stock options typically have a vesting period - the options are split into 4 years, which 25% being vested every year.

## Why
- If the employee is directly given those shares, ze will get some assets with him, **but that will be taxable**
- So as a workaround, employees are given **Stock Options** - Option to buy (exercise) certain number of shares at a per-share `strike price`: `company-valuation/#total-shares`  
In fact if the company gets acquired, you can just collect the total margin as part of the acquisition paperwork.
- This is where the fun happens- if the company goes profitable or sells out (which will  at a share price greater than the strike price at which you bought), hence making you a nice margin.  

## Note

- Have an eye on the **expiry date** of the option.
- You can buy stock options (opposed to stocks) for public companies like Microsoft. You have to pay a certain fees for it, and the longer the expiry duration, the more expensive it is.


## Questions and further stuff

- What happens if the company doesn't IPO/sell etc. until after the expiry date of your options?
- Stock options negotiation
- Study my stock options in current company
