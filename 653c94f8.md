# Comparison

Even with a bit of thought, it's clear that you cannot beat everyone in everything. Yet, we often compare ourselves to others. Their accomplishments is a painful reminder of what we lack.

But we all are running different races. We determine and curate the race we want to run, it's a highly personal affair. It doesn't make sense to compare ourselves with some arbitrary vertical of skill or status.

Competition is an important motivator. But you should be very very careful about with whom and why you're competing with someone.

It's not only about competition. Even after deciding what's truly important to you, it's possible to have other things creep into your life, eating away the precious resource that is time. This lengthens the time it takes to reach your goals; making you inefficient at reaching your actual goals. 

"what not to do" is as important as "what to do"
