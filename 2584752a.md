# Rust

```bash
## compile a file
rustc sample.rs && ./sample

```

Cargo: rust's build system and package manager

```bash
cargo new new_project

cargo build ## just build (and install new dependencies, if there)
cargo run   ## build and run
cargo check ## just check if the code can compile. Faster than cargo build, 
            ## so used in development flow
cargo build --release ## build the release profile
cargo update ## update the dependencies
```
Cargo creates a file Cargo.toml which uses TOML as it's configuration language.

- **const** can never be mut, while let variables can be mut. Also, const has to be set to some constant and not a return value from a function. They must always be annotated.
- We can change the type of a variable with shadowing. what's the use of shadowing?
- scalar types: integer, float, boolean, character
- a char is 4 bytes in size and can store unicode scalar values 
- compound data types: tuples and array
- a tuple can be destructured (pattern matching) to get individual elements or simply use tuple.0, tuple.1 etc. 
- arrays
```rust
// compound: arrays - allocated on stack
let arr: [i32; 5] = [1,2,3,4,5];
let all_3 = [3; 5];
```

- statements vs expression: the former doesn't return a value, the later does.
```rust
let y = {
    let x = 3;
    x + 1  // no semicolon, adding one makes it a statement and the block won't return anything
};
```

- loops and breaks (can return values)
```rust

let mut counter = 0;
let result = loop {
    counter += 1;
    if counter == 10 {
        break counter;
    }
};

println!("tried {} times", result);


/// range and iter

for number in (1..4).rev() { println!("{}!", number); }  // or (1..=3)
println!("liftoff!");
```

- the **prelude**: list of things that Rust automatically imports into every rust program.
- **String** type: UTF-8 encoded bit of string

- generate random number:
```rust
use rand::Rng;
let secret_num = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);
```

- view doc of a cargo project and all dependencies: `cargo doc --open`

## Enums
```rust

#[derive(Debug)]
    enum Color {
        Black(i32),
        Rest { r: i32, g: i32, b: i32 },
    }
```

- we can define functions for enums as well (just like structs using `impl`).
- rust uses `Option` to handle "something or nothing" aspect of enums or other types:
```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

## matching
```rust
let colorblind: Option<Color> = Some(green);

match colorblind {
    Some(c) => {
        println!("color is {:?}", c);
        c
    },
    None => {
        println!("I'm color blind all right!");
        Color::Blind
    }
}
```

- matches are exhaustive
- there is a special pattern `_` which can match any value
- `if let` can be used as a syntactic sugar for cases where you just need to deal with one value of the enum.

- matching in the above form causes ownership transfer. We can use reference borrowing here.
```rust
match colorblind {
    Some(ref c) => {
        println!("1: color is {:?}", c);
    },
    None => {
        println!("I'm color blind all right!");
    }
}

match &colorblind {
    Some(c) => {
        println!("2: color is {:?}", c);
    },
    None => {
        println!("I'm color blind all right!");
    }
}
```

## Rustic emacs mode setup

`s-l h h` : show documentation of symbol under point  
`M-j` to outline the current module for quickly navigating between functions  
`s-l r r` : lsp-rename : useful for refactoring a symbol under point
`M-.`: goto implementation for the symbol under point; `M-,` to jump back
`M-?`: find usages of a function
`C-c C-c C-l`: rustic-cargo-clippy : run rust linter
`C-c C-c C-k`: cargo check - faster than cargo build
`C-c C-c C-b`: cargo build
`C-c C-c C-r`: cargo run
