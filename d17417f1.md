# Help API of software

With stackoverflow and plethora of blogs coming in, there's a tendency to default to them to find solutions rather than references like man pages. Most of the software has a way to find help while staying inside the software (command line etc.). One of the best things you can do while learning a new tech is then to identify what is the **Help API** of that software.  
This also includes references documents where EVERYTHING about that tech is mentioned and indexed.

For example, for `postgresql`:

- `help` is the mother of all helps.
-  help for the all SQL commands: `\h`  
```bash
Available help:
  ABORT                            CREATE USER
  ALTER AGGREGATE                  CREATE USER MAPPING
  ALTER COLLATION                  CREATE VIEW
  ALTER CONVERSION                 DEALLOCATE
  ALTER DATABASE                   DECLARE
  ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES         DELETE
  ALTER DOMAIN                     DISCARD
  ALTER EVENT TRIGGER              DO
  
    .....<removed for brevity>....
```

- help for all psql commands: `\?`
```bash
General
  \copyright             show PostgreSQL usage and distribution terms
  \crosstabview [COLUMNS] execute query and display results in crosstab
  \errverbose            show most recent error message at maximum verbosity
  \g [(OPTIONS)] [FILE]  execute query (and send results to file or |pipe);
                         \g with no arguments is equivalent to a semicolon
  \gdesc                 describe result of query, without executing it
  
  .....<removed for brevity>....
```


Another example is the `dir()` command for python, which lists all the symbols imported by a particular module (current module if nothing is specified)
