# Negotiation

> Negotiating does not mean browbeating or grinding someone down. It simply means playing the emotional game that human society is set up for. In this world, you get what you ask for; you just have to ask correctly.  -- Chris Voss


- Mindset:  
  - good negotiators, going in, know that they have to be ready for possible surprises; great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal the surprises they are certain exist.
  - being right isn't the key to a successful negotiation--having the right mindset is.
  - Negotiation is not a battle of arguments. People who view it thus become overwhelemed by the voices in their head. Negotiation is a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much info as possible.
  - Put a smile on your face. Positivity creates mental agility in both you and your counterpart.
  

## Few rules
- open ended questions: get the person talking and reveal information that might be useful

- listen: the worst thing you can do while negotiating (or conversing) is to prepare your arguments or plan the next things to say. It's a universally applicable premise that people want to be understood and accepted.  
It's not easy to listen well. We are easily distracted. We engage in selective listening, hearing, and tend to filter out ideas that do not confirm with our beliefs and biases.  
The goal is to identiy the counterparts actualy needs (monetary, emotional or otherwise)  
To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say.

- straightforward statements  
Sometimes it's okay to just drop something which you would or won't do, as a matter of fact. Do not put it as a question, as it offers an alternative and begs further discussion.

## Be a mirror

- Mirroring:  
Research: two group of waiters, one which lavished praise and encouragement ("great", "sure" etc.); the other just mirrored their customers by repeating their orders back to them. The second group received higher tips.  
It gives you the ability to disagree without being disagreeable.  
**How**: 
1. use the late-night FM DJ voice.
2. start with "I'm sorry..."
3. Mirror
4. Silence (at least 4 seconds)
5. Repeat

    - use mirrors for the other party to empathize and bond with you. Keep people talking, buy your side time to regroup. Encourage the counterparts to reveal their strategy. 

## Don't feel their pain, label it.

- Emotions: 
Too many books focus on negotiation as an act between two reational creatures. It's anything but rational. It's often an emotional game, with self-worth tied to the results. Emotions aren't the obstacles, they are the means.

- Playing dumb or saying "I don't understand" is a valid negotiation technique  
But ignoring other party's position only builds up frustration and makes them less likely to do what you want.

- Empathy is understanding how another human being is feeling. Tactical empathy is one step beyond - understanding the mindset and feelings of another in that moment and also what is *behind* those feelings, so you can increase your influence in all the moments that follow.
