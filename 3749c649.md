# Onion Routing

- overlay network
- size of the packets remains the same; 
- can definitely get slower since the packets are encrypted multiple times as it goes through onion routers in the network.
- if attacker spoofs on start and destination link, the attack becomes easier.
- onion routing is not truly anonymous, your actions can be traced back to you. The thing it does is to make it difficult for people to trace.
- only the exit node (and source node) has the ability to decrypt the layers of the onion.
- vulnerability: traffic analysis on start and destination links can allow you to link users to activities and websites. This is difficult to do though.
