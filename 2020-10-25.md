## Rest in motion: Work is a never ending stream

For most people, the ideal state to be in is the ground state where all work is finished. We are constantly bombared with ideas where we have to work hard at our jobs to earn a vacation or bust our asses for decades to retire. Heavens is the place where everybody just lounges around.  
This is bullshit.  
Staying idle is boring, that's why people take up personal projects, read books or travel. The ideal state is not the idle state, but when you're going through **stimulating tasks at the right pace with occassional rests** in between.  
When you model work as a finite state which has to completed to achieve nirvana, every email notification/curious co-worker asking questions/new bugs becomes jarring, as they further the gap between the current and the ideal state, where you can finally relax.  
The current situation however is that whenever people are not in the ideal state (with all finished work), they are taking damage. When their homework is not done, they are taking damage. When they haven't called their family members, they are taking damage. Some part of them always yearns to be in the rest state, and if they aren't, they take damage. This is a mistake in a world where work is a never ending stream.  
Rest is not a reward for going through all your personal obligations ([You dropped them, remember?][1]). Rather, rest and personal care are part of the goal. Disconnect your impulse to rest from whether or not the world is in a stable state (FYI, it's not going to be stable in a very long time).  
Be sensitive to when you are moving too fast (overwhelmed) or too slow (boredom) through the stream. The ideal pace is when you can sustain work without exhaustion or boredom.
