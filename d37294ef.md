# Motivated stopping

I've learned that the self is not a unified thing. It's an ever-conflicting mix of preferences, attitudes and imagined scenarios. And the stoic self says, well, don't worry about this horrible situation as it's not in your control. Now, often with this thought, I end up **taking the easier route** (this is something Yudowsky had talked about). It's easy to make an ok effort and think - well, I did my best. Now it's beyond my control. \
I'm able to jettison this shit out at times when the situation needs some desperate action. One can always rely on getting emotional when desperate actions are needed. But emotions often elicits an over the top action, and forgetting the exact problem you are solving is not uncommon. But for everyday topics you're rather cold about, you can always shrug your shoulders and say it's out of your hands now. It's classic motivated stopping. \
I wonder if stoicism can be extended here - I like its hard logic, but before you shrug your shoulders, think about what would be *really* needed to solve an issue. Generating the answers do not mean you have to solve it. There's no obligation. You can always choose that it's not worth your time or effort. It's okay to decide that though a solution exists, it's outside your current inclinations. This is important - You don't want to discourage solution generation by jumping onto the most ridiculous solution. **Brute force, and ridiculous solutions are welcome**. Don't do it because you [should]([[[f655f141]]]). The important thing to get into the habit of is know when motivated stopping is occurring.
