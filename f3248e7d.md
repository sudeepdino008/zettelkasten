# Accurately define your success criterion

- You can and should follow multiple pursuits, but spend some time in deciding 'what' you are looking to achieve? What's your criterion for success? Saying 'work on it as hard as possible' is not accurate at all, and sets you up for failure.
- For example, if I'm  looking to understand Godel's incompleteness theorem, I'm looking to i) understand the history and thought progression leading towards the theorem. Why is it important and why was it so distruptive ii) All the amazing slew of ideas (for example those presented in GEB) which results from this particular theorem.
- Once you've decided the 'what', the next step is to decide how you're gonna measure that you've reached this stage and are successful. Continuing with the above example, it can be that you're able to write a rough outline of the history of thought leading up to the Godel's theorem. That would be good enough. Even thought it sounds great, getting into the nitty-gritty of it is not my goal, giving a rough outline is.
