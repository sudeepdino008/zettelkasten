## Replacing Guilt Review

If I was a tyrant, and found anyone to have a morsel of guilt, I'd force them to read this.

This is important stuff. Too many people (including me) are guilty (oops!) of letting guilt be a primary motivation source. 

"Why do we feel guilty?"
"What are the things we feel guilty about?"
"Are there acceptable and not acceptable types of guilt?"
"Wouldn't I lose the desire to do things if Î™ eliminate guilt?"
"How do we get rid of guilt?"

Nate doesn't shirk away from the important questions, which makes this sequence nuanced and practical. Highly recommended if you use guilt to motivate yourself for your actions in life; Or if there's an undercurrent of vague guilt for not living up to the kind of person you want to be. etc. etc.
I'm amazed at how underrated this is. Perhaps the lack of decent marketing is to blame. But it's always nice when solid things spread via word-of-mouth.
