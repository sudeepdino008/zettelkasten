# Godel's Incompleteness Theorem

## Rough notes

Godel's incompleteness theorems concerns with the limits of provability in formal axiomatic systems. The first theorem states that **For any consistent formal system X in which certain amount of arithmetic can be carried out, there'll exist theorems which are neither provable or unprovable i.e. the system is incomplete**  
The second theorem states that **Assuming that the consistent formal axiomatic system is indeed consistent, the proof that it is so cannot be given from with the system itself.**

completeness: for any statement X of the formal system, either X or ~X is derivable within the system.
consistency: There is no statement X of the formal system such that both X and ~X are derivable within the system.

to assert that a formula X is "formally undecidable" means that neither X or ~X is demonstrable inside the formal calculus of interest (e.g. PM)

A common misunderstanding is to interpret the first theorem as saying "there are truths which cannot be proved". This is incorrect--the incompleteness theorems don't deal with proofs in an absolute sense, but only concerns derivability in some particular formal system or another. For any statement A unprovable in a particular formal system F, there are other formal systems in which A is provable (say by taking A as axiom).  
There is but a different implication here. The Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZFC) is an extremely powerful standard axiom system which is sufficient to derive all "ordinary" mathematics from it. From Godel's first theorem, there are theorems not provable in ZFC; Proving those would need methods which go beyond the ZFC. In some sense, these theorems are not provable in today's "ordinary" mathematical methods and axioms.

1. Godel showed how to construct a formula G of PM that represents the mathematical statement - **"The formula G is not demonstrable using the formulas of PM"**. G has a godel number of g, so we can say - `"The formula that has Godel number g is not demonstrable."`
2. Godel also showed that G is demonstrable iff ~G is demonstrable. So if PM is consistent, then neither G nor ~G are demonstrable i.e. G is `formally undecidable`
3. though G is not formally demonstrable, it is *true*
4. Realization that since G is both true and undecidable, PM must be incomplete.  
It's also *essentially* incomplete - even if some axioms were added and G became formally derivable, another formula G' could be constructed in the modified system which was true and undecidable.
5. Godel described how to construct a formula A of PM that represents the meta-mathematical statement: 'PM is consistent'; and he showed that though `A => G` is formally demonstrable, A is not.  
This means that the consistency of PM cannot be established by any chain of logical reasoning that can be mirrored within the formal reasoning system that PM itself constitutes.
