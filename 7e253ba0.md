# Android: Activity

- Provides a way to launch apps.
- The traditional paradigm is to use main method. But since the app can open in different places depending on the user's journey, a different paradigm is needed.
-  When one app invokes another (like a web browser invoking share feature in whatsapp), it invokes an activity in the app, rather than the app as an atomic whole.
- There can be different activities depending on the entry points of the app.
