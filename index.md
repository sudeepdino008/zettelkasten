# Overview
Personal zettelkasten based on [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/).  
Zettelkasten are more of a "second brain" rather than a blog. Therefore, the expectation is not to have blog worthy notes. You might derive some value out of it, despite the notes being contextual and unpolished for large parts.
