# Flow: The Psychology of Happiness

Man is heavily influenced by his genetics. While societal forces seek to exploit these pleasure/pain points to redirect our energies for external profits. A person is fully socialized when all his goals are dictated by the society.
The way to eliminate these external motives, which are going to thrash you about here and there, is via control of the consciousness. Many cultures have come up with their own way to achieve this, but it's still not famous or widespread because:
1. The cultural context in which a certain practice was relevant is now gone. Strict Yogic practices to block sensations is not something people would do now.
2. The task of controlling your consciousness is not merely a cognitive task. It requires the will to emotionally control and restraint yourself. You're fighting biological urges here.
