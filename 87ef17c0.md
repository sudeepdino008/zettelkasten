# Multipliers

Meditation and exercise are multipliers - If I do them well, and the effects show, I'm energetic and have a lot of awareness and focus. This translates to doing anything else much better. What are your multipliers currently? Is there something you can do in your personal life or career, that gives you the maximum leverage?
