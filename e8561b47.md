# Testflight Distribution

1. Only a single version (3.8.0 or 3.9.1) is allowed, but within the version multiple builds (211, 212 etc)
2. A public link can be enabled and shared, which allows upto 10k users to install your app 
OR send the invitation to the users via their emails.
3. Build remains active for 90 days after upload, after that the users won't be able to install the app. Infact even the installed apps won't run (a dialog box appears - \<APP\>  has expired.)
To get extension on the test duration bump up the build number and release a new build, though that'll need the user to open the link again to get access to updated build.
