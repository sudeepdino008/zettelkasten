# Rust: Unsafe


unsafe rust: do not enforce memory safety guarantees of rust. underlying computer hardware is inherently unsafe. Unsafe operations expose a whole set of tasks not possible with safe rust.
unsafe superpowers:
- dereference a raw pointer
- call an unsafe function or method
- access or modify a mutable static variable
- implement an unsafe trait
- access fields of `union`s



## dereferencing a raw pointer
- with raw pointers, you can break the mutable/immutable borrowing rule; pointer isn't guaranteed to point to valid memory; allowed to be null; doesn't implement any automatcic cleanup
- raw pointers can be used to have a mutable and immutable reference at the same time, or point to an invalid memory address. So dereferencing a raw pointer from safe rust is not allowed.
- you might want to use raw pointers for use cases like interfacing with C, or building up safe abstractions that the borrow checker doesn't understand.

```rust
fn raw_p() {
    let mut num = 5;

    let r1 = &num as *const i32;
    let r2 = &mut num as *mut i32;

    //dereference of raw pointer is unsafe and requires unsafe function or block
    //println!("r1 and r2 {} ; {}", *r1, *r2);

    unsafe {
        println!("r1 and r2 {} ; {}", *r1, *r2);
    }
}
```

## calling an unsafe function or method

```rust

fn unsafe_b() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    let r = &mut v[..];
    let (a, b) = split_at_mut(r, 3);
    assert_eq!(a, &mut [1, 2, 3]);
    assert_eq!(b, &mut [4, 5, 6]);
}

fn split_at_mut(slice: &mut [i32], mid: usize) -> (&mut [i32], &mut [i32]) {
    let len = slice.len();
    assert!(mid <= len);

    // rust doesn't know that we're referencing different parts of the slice, and so borrowing twice is fine here. Instead it complains about borrowing more than once.
    // this is a use case for unsafe rust as we've more info
    //(&mut slice[..mid], &mut slice[mid..])

    let ptr = slice.as_mut_ptr();
    unsafe {
        (
            slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr, mid),
            slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr.add(mid), len - mid),
        )
    }
}

unsafe fn unsafe_func(r1: *const i32, r2: *mut i32) {
    // only unsafe blocks or other unsafe functions can call a unsafe function
    println!("r1 and r2 {} ; {}", *r1, *r2);
}

```

## implementing an unsafe trait
- for example, implementing `Send` and `Sync` traits on raw pointers need unsafe because there's no way for compiler to verify that the safe rusting rules are followed.

```rust

fn unsafe_trait() {
    unsafe trait Untr {}

    unsafe impl Untr for i32 {}
}

```
