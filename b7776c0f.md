<div id='intro'/>

- Write as if you've something important to show to the world. The guiding metaphor of classic style is seeing the world - The writer can see something which the reader hasn't noticed yet, and he reorients the gaze so that she can see for herself.
- The key to good style, rather than following a list of commandments, is to have a clear conception of the make-believe world in which you're pretending to communicate.
- The purpose of writing is presentation, and its motive is disinterested truth.
- Classic style puts aside inappropriate philosophical questions about its endeavor and gets started with its enterprise straight away. It's purpose is to exclusively treat the subject.  
Even scientists, with their committment to see the world as it is, are a *bit* postmodern. They know that our understanding of our world is through models, that the world doesn't reveal itself to us easily, and that our ways of understanding the world must be scrutinized for hidden biases. It's just that good science writers don't flaunt their anxiety, they artfully conceal it for clarity's sake.
- The requirement that the writer should have his thoughts formed before putting it down is outlandish. It's only important that it *seems* to the reader that the writer had his thoughts sorted out. An analogy is that of a famous chef pulling out a perfect cake in the show's final minutes, although the messy work had been done beforehand and behind the scenes.
- Classic prose is a play, a pleasant illusion. The writer must maintain the illusion of looking through a window onto a scene, rather than a slog through mess of words.
- What follows is a list of don'ts. Each corresponds to a particular in which a writer can stray from the classic style.

<div id="Metadiscourse" />

### Metadiscourse

- Avoid metadiscourse: previews that read like scrunched-up table of contents do not help the reader, is often tedious and hard to follow. It's talk about the talk.
- Avoid signposting (a kind of metadiscourse): "Say what you are about to say. Say it. And then repeat what you just said"  
This advice comes from the art of rhetoric, where the listeners attention might be diverted away and so repeating statements allows most of the listeners to grasp every statement. But this is not needed for writing - The readers can just go back and read the statement. This is intrusive in classic style which simulates a conversation.  
Another problem with signposting is that it can take more effort to understand it, than if you clearly laid out the course. Good writing takes advantage of reader's expectation about where to go next. It arranges the thoughts in a logical sequence (general to specific, tells a story with a narrative arc etc.)  
However sometimes signposting might be needed else the reader has no idea where she is being led.

#### Ways to avoid metadiscourse

- One way to introduce a topic without metadiscourse is to open with a question:
> the chapter introduces the factors that causes names to rise and fall in popularity.
vs
> What makes a name rise and fall in popularity?

- Another is to use the guiding metaphor behind classic style, vision: The content in the passage of writing is treated like a happening in the world than can be seen with one's eyeballs:
> The preceding paragraph demonstrated that parents sometimes give a boy's name to a girl, but never vice versa.
vs 
> As we have seen, parents sometimes give a boy's name to a girl, but never vice versa.

The active parties are the reader and writers, and blocks of printing don't have a mind of their own to "summarize" or "demonstrate" something.

- Use the good old pronoun 'we'  
This allows you to use metaphors like moving together or cooperating on a project.
> The first topic to be discussed is proper names.
vs.
> Let's beging with proper names.

- Even if summary is being written, it shouldn't sound like words are being just reshuffled and presented again. The summary should have enough keywords (from the passage being summarized), and be a self-contained coherent sentence in its own right, almost as if the material being summarized never existed at all.

<div id="pro-narc" />

### Professional narcissism

- Example:
> In recent years, an increasing number of psychologists and linguists have turned their attention to the problem of child language acquisition. In this article, recent research on this process will be reviewed. 

People are not interested in how professors spend their time. Look/Show directly at what you aim to communicate:

> All children acquire the ability to speak a language without explicit lessons. How do they accomplish this feat? 

- Some writers also whinge about the difficulty of what they are about to do:
> What are intractable conflicts? Intractability is a controversial concept, which means different things to different people. 

In classic style, the writer assumes that the reader is intelligent enough to know that some concepts are difficult to understand, some contreversies difficult to resolve. The reader is there to see what the writer can do about it.

<div id="shud-quotes" />

### Shudder quotes

- Commonly use to distance oneself from an idiom
> She is a "quick study" and has been able to educate herself in virtually any area that interests her. 
- Quotes have their uses, but squeamishness about one's choice of words is not one of them. Classic style is confident about it's voice. 

<div id="comp-hedge" />

### Avoid compulsive hedging

- Trying too hard to define the concept more clearly. Or trying to evade responsibility about the statements you make (It's a bureaucratic imperative CYA - Cover your anatomy) :
"almost impossible", "so to speak", "somewhat", "to a certain degree", "I would argue" 
- The opposite of CYA is So Sue Me. Classic style is confident about its voice and relies on the reader to grant the common sense and charity which we have in everyday conversation, where we know the speaker means "in general" or "I would argue".
- Sometimes you would want to hedge a sentence. You might want to specify where the conditions don't hold true rather than being coy or reluctant about it. Or specify the hedging precisely, like "half of the population". Hedging should be a choice, not a tic.
- Another form of compulsive hedging is the use of brackets to stuff in caveats and small details.  
> That works for me (unless of course I change my mind)
Brackets help seperate the key details and smaller caveats. But you've to be consider if the caveat is needed at all. Classic style is a conversation - Is the caveat already understood? Or can you rely on your reader to grant that common sense and clarity?


<div id="cliches" />

### Avoid cliches like a plague
- A reader will soon stop converting the words into mental images, and resort to mouthing the words.
- Search for fresh similes and idioms that keep the reader's sensory cortex lit up.

<div id="abstractions" />

### Minimize abstractions
- Classic style minimizes abstractions which cannot be seen with the naked eye.
- This doesn't mean that we can't express abstract topics in classic style (Greene's text on multiverse). It's that the events making up the subject matter is shown transparently, with real characters unfolding the plot by doing things, rather than naming abstract concepts that encapsulate those events in a single word.
> I have serious doubts that trying to amend the Constitution would work on an actual level . On the aspirational level , however, a constitutional amendment strategy may be more valuable. 
vs 
> I doubt that trying to amend the Constitution would actually succeed, but it may be valuable to aspire to it. 

"Level" and "strategy" are verbal tombs here, which bury the actions and actors. Only when they're chopped away can the flow of the story properly come into the view, the illusion be restored.

- Zombie nouns: nouns without any actors. Rather than *postponing* something, you implement a *postponement*
- It takes a good deal of memory and effort to keep track of the characters denoted by he, her, they etc.  
I,me,you are downright helpful as they promote the conversational style.

<div id="passive" />

### Know when to use passive
- Passive voice allows you to get rid of an unncessary actor in your passage:
Active: 
> The pilots flew the helicopters in to put out the fire.
Passive: 
> Helicopters were flown in to put out the fires.

- Active and passive differ in which character gets to be the subject.  
an active construction trains the readers eye to someone who is doing something:
> See that lady with the shopping bag? She's pelting the mime with a zucchini.
in passive construction, it's the character to which the thing is happening:
> See that mime? He's being pelted with a zucchini by the lady with the shopping bag.

Sometimes the ability to omit a minor character is handy, because they just act as distractions.

- Using the wrong voice can make the reader crane back and forth like a spectator at a tennis match: 
> See that lady with the shopping bag? A mime is being pelted with zucchini by her .
