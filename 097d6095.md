# Nihilism: The Emptiness of the Machine

- We're here for the same reason as stones: none
- Why nihilism rouses fear - we're wrong about reality
- bashing of traditional metaphysics - why modern metaphysics is mature and important.
- Nihilism doesn't seek to explain or guide man, but to situate him impartially within what is known to science.
- Subjectivity and objectivity (that which exists independently) - anthropomorphising existence - delineating the boundaries with greater precision
- Investigating reality without needing to seek some certainties sets us up to construct an impartial view. We adopt a neutral and basic posture.
- We cannot bother about existence being illusion, because it cannot be investigated. Whatever it is, we face with open eyes, seeing clearly, without the need for certainty.
- Why humanizing of reality is a mistake and why the error occurs - we access reality via a construction - these things are biased towards the purpose of genetic propagation.
- Out consciousness is conditional (depends on us existing)
- With this distiniction of subjectivity/objectivity, nihilism stands more clearly - the objective world is what is meaningless/empty; meaning/goals/intentions make sense only in the context of biological machines.
- Nihilism will not lead us to great discoveries; it'll only clear the path, so we can build a more coherent view of reality.
- there's no objective distinction between man and other things.
- the fact that something is subjective is not an objection to its significance, only a condition if existence; the condition of existing as a subjective phenomenon.
- After death, nothing remains of our own subjectivity. The television is turned off. 
- Deconstructing man doesn't mean they lose their values. Even if colors are subjective fiction, we continue to cultivate the concept because it's handy for decorating walls of the house. If colors don't lose value because they don't have "transcendental essence", why would a man?
- Can an idea support itself )"rise from its ashes") once it has been annihilated by nihilism? (moral value, justice, cooperation can arise again. "The ten commandments" - not so much)
- Certainty poses danger and wars. Nihilism, doubt, uncertainty wages no war.
- What nihilism cannot do? - It cannot start social apocalypse or militant state. It can only make us distressed as we lose out illusions.
- Nihilism only helps us discern the facts more closely. It doesn't change anything in practice.
- When we talk of "emptiness", it's basically that the thing is empty/free of the subjective, antropomorphized concepts.
- It doesn't make sense to try and "live" nihilism, as it is kind of perspective that suffocates us.  
> The consciousness of the nullity of life hits us as a paralysing vertigo - and man's own biological constitutions doesn't favor this kind of approach to reality
- So how do nihilists live? They live as they please, with open eyes. They emphasize objectivity, but doesn't mean that they despise subjectivity. We are subjective beings, and can only live so. If life is a dream, nihilism attempts to make it a lucid dream.
- Atheistic disbelief is a particular case of nihilism.
So fat nihilism has been grasped intellectually. If we grasp the concept emotionally too, it can cause us to mourn as we lose something of emotional value. We can become delirious, wallowing in this nihilism.
- The most reasonable escape is to admit that understanding reality and to live in it are separate things governed by separate rules.
- In long term, nihilism is incompatible with maintenance of life. It has to be "overcome". But what we overcome is practical nihilism (its effects). Do not confuse it with refuting theoretical nihilism
- Nihilism paralyzes us at first. It's because it's only the illusions that kept us moving before. Now, we must learn to walk again, however this is not tantamount to overcoming nihilism, but to acquiring the ability to better separate out knowledge from practical needs.
- It's impossible to justify a subjective life through objective nothingness. The only way we can live rationally in an absurd world is through madness.


## Questions

Some of the questions that the book seeks to answer-
- what is nihilism?
- what is meant by existential "emptiness"?
- what are the limitations of nihilism?
- why do people fear nihilism?
- how do you reconcile being emotionally affected by nihilism?

## Review

Nihilism is a logical stance to take. There's surely no objective meaning of my life or yours. You can manufacture one, sure. The universe has unfolded from inanimate atoms and compounds to single celled life to complex beings such as us. And inanimate we shall once again become, as the suns extinguish and universe becomes cold and uninhabitable.

My problem was what to do with this intellectual realisation? It has thrown me often in despair, and I've learned that living involves an element of exaggeration, or an injection of fiction. Andre calls this reliance on fiction to live properly as "madness". It's as if subjective beings such as us cannot live from a purely objective view.

The answer that Andre gives is that Nihilism is a negative philosophy which helps you weed out a lot of bullshit from your worldview, but doesn't give you a philosophy of life, doesn't tell you how to live. It helps you clean your view. It's about situating man impartially within what is known to science.

Nihilism paralyzes us at first. It's because it's only the illusions that kept us moving before. Now, we must learn to walk again, however this is not tantamount to overcoming nihilism, but to acquiring the ability to better separate out knowledge of nihilism from the practical needs of a biological, social being.

Nihilism as an intellectual tool serves the precise purpose of purging our worldview from beliefs and dogmas. But it is incompatible with life when you allow it to seep through into your emotional life. It causes only despair. We need some amount of fiction to live our lives and cannot allow nihilism to eliminate it from us.

The passage which gives a small flavour of the book's title:

>let's imagine the following situation: we were researching in a library and, by chance, we found a document with our name. As we read it, we find that all our family members are not actually human beings: they are machines preprogrammed to live with us. They like us automatically from the beginning. Even their feelings are calculations of their central processors. That is what we read in the document. Well, even if such an understanding did not change anything in practice, would not knowing it be emotionally devastating? The feeling that everything has never been more than a fantasy crushes us. Now it is enough to realize that this is not fiction: they really are machines, and so are we. Everyone is. Life is a dream inside a machine. Faced with this, we are astonished, perplexed, and "mourning" is the best word that occurs to us to describe this feeling that something has died, although we cannot tell exactly what.
