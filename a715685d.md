# Crypto: Consensus mechanisms

## Proof of Work
- Somebody can prove to you that they've engaged in a significant amount of computation. They amount to puzzles. They are easily verifiable.
- Bitcoin leverages POW protocol in context of creating transation blockchains.
- Other applications: It's also can be used in denying DOS attacks by asking the client to solve a POW puzzle before making requests to server. Or avoiding SPAM emails.
- challenge string (C) + proof/response (P - generated by prover) --hashed--> gives a string with very specific property (first d bits are 0 etc. - the 'd' maps to the difficulty of POW)
- [Reusable Proof of Work (RPoW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work#Reusable_proof-of-work) - basically allows PoW tokens to be reused. So a service provider can demand RPoW for exchange of its services. The new owner can they reuse the RPoW for his/her own purposes [a third party server which also accepts RPoW]. It never really caught on though.  
The purpose of RPoW is as token money. Just like the value of real gold coins are underpinned by the amount of gold needed to create it, the value of RPoW tokens is underpinned by the amount of computation needed to 'mint' the original PoW token.
- PoW networks can face Sybil attacks or DOS attacks.
- PoW solves the distributed consensus problem (no single trusted authority) while also allows for free entry into the consensus process (thus solving the question of who gets to influence the consensus process). It's also resistant to Sybil attacks.
- In PoW, the weight of single node in the consensus process is proportional to the amount of computational resources it brings. Contrast this with proof of Stake (PoS) where this weight is proportional to the currency holdings.

### [Sybil attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack)
- One in which a reputation system is subverted by creating multiple identities. A reputation systems's vulnerability to sybil attack depends on how easy it is to create new identities, whether the identities are fungible, how easily the reputation system accepts input from identities which are not linked back to a trusted source.


### Proof of Stake

### Sharding
