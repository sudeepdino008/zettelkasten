# Definitions of retirement

There are 3 definitions of retirement:

1. You've enough money, and so you retire and don't need to work.
2. You become an ascetic, and so you don't need much to get by, and can do without working.
3. You do what you absolutely love, such that it isn't work, but play. Then you are not working, you play what you want. There's freedom and no work.
