how dificult is a 51% attack?  
- There's a misconception that bitcoin has 10k nodes. These are just listening nodes (which relay the information to other nodes). There are "full nodes" in the network, which actually ensure that the blockchain rules are followed. There are about 100k full nodes in the bitcoin network, though the number might be more because owners often block the 8333 port of their full node in order to keep them from discovery or reduce network traffic etc. (ref: [1](https://twitter.com/francispouliot_/status/1125139855313387520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1125139855313387520%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin-100000-nodes-vulnerable-cryptocurrency), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/n5n1i7/where_can_i_get_an_accurate_number_of_the_active/), [3](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-network-surpasses-100000-nodes-new-data-shows/))
- Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum Classic have suffered 51% attack (as many as [3 times](underwent 5)). It basically boils down to the overall computational power of the network. Networks with lesser computational power are easier to attack.
- Even for bitcoin, Ghash.io obtained 51% hashing power in 2014. The pool voluntarily capped their hashing power at 39.99% and adviced other networks to follow suite to restore faith in the network.
- According to Vitalik [here](https://youtu.be/3x1b_S6Qp2Q?t=2493) the economic cost of doing a 51% attack is in the low billions of dollars.


can quantum computing break the cryptographic problems that miners need to do?

[Short answer is no.](undustry is) There are two class of problems - one is Shwartz, for this the industry is ready to switch to it. The second class Grover's algorithm, makes it easier but not exponentially easier. So it'll be similar to when ASIICs came into the market.



## Byzantine problem
It is solved when generals are trusted, but not when generals are not trusted. PoW allows to use computational resources as a proxy for trust/identity.
