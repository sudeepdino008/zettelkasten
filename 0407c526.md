# Cryptocurrency: Security

how dificult is a 51% attack?  
- There's a misconception that bitcoin has 10k nodes. These are just listening nodes (which relay the information to other nodes). There are "full nodes" in the network, which actually ensure that the blockchain rules are followed. There are about 100k full nodes in the bitcoin network, though the number might be more because owners often block the 8333 port of their full node in order to keep them from discovery or reduce network traffic etc. (ref: [1](https://twitter.com/francispouliot_/status/1125139855313387520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1125139855313387520%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin-100000-nodes-vulnerable-cryptocurrency), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/n5n1i7/where_can_i_get_an_accurate_number_of_the_active/), [3](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-network-surpasses-100000-nodes-new-data-shows/))
- Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum Classic have suffered 51% attack (as many as [3 times](underwent 5)). It basically boils down to the overall computational power of the network. Networks with lesser computational power are easier to attack.
- Even for bitcoin, Ghash.io obtained 51% hashing power in 2014. The pool voluntarily capped their hashing power at 39.99% and adviced other networks to follow suite to restore faith in the network.
- According to Vitalik [here](https://youtu.be/3x1b_S6Qp2Q?t=2493) the economic cost of doing a 51% attack is in the low billions of dollars.


can quantum computing break the cryptographic problems that miners need to do?

[Short answer is no.](undustry is) There are two class of problems - one is Shwartz, for this the industry is ready to switch to it. The second class Grover's algorithm, makes it easier but not exponentially easier. So it'll be similar to when ASIICs came into the market.



## Byzantine problem
It is solved when generals are trusted, but not when generals are not trusted. PoW allows to use computational resources as a proxy for trust/identity.


## how do I store my cryptocurrency?
- all about managing private and public keys
- hot storage (network connectivity ) and cold storage (offline). People can send crypto to you even if you are using cold storage. Some blockchains however don't allow that.
- wallet sofrware (hot) - usually a SPV node - unsafe though
- paper wallet (cold) - pub/private key printed out on a piece of paper. convenience: low, availability: low, security: medium
- Brain Wallet (cold) - remember a pass phrase and use the hash of it as a seed to pseudorandomly generate a keypair.
- hardware wallet (hybrid hot/cold) - can generate keys or sign transactions, but secret keys never leave device. 
- usually using different addresses is encouraged in bitcoin so as to make it difficult to pin that address to you.
- secret sharing: divide the key into N parts, I should only be able to construct the key if I've atleast k parts. Also, If I have less than k parts, no information about the key should be revealed to me.

Suppose N=2, K=2, and secret key S is 128 bits
- generate a random 128-bit value R.
- two shares: R and (S ^ R)
- together we can calculate S; otherwise, basically just random numbers

works when N=K. What if K!=N?
- 2-of-n secret sharing: you represent the shares as points on a line. Only if you know 2 points can you determine the what the line is.
- general k-of-n also exists where you construct a k degree polynomial.

The drawback with the above is that the secret key constructed at the end can be still stolen. there are ways to make partial signatures and if enough actors generate partial signartures, they can sign a transaction with a key without ever revealing the key or even their key shares. [Threshold signatures]
