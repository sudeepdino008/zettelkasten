# Tax rates on mutual funds in India

resource: [Mutual funds Tax Rates](https://www.beginnersbuck.com/tax-mutual-funds/)

**Always**, only the profit is taxable and not the invested amount.

### Equity mutual funds
- If the profit is realized in **short term (capital gain)** (you bought and sold within 1 year), the tax rate is 15%.
- If the profit is realized in **long term (capital gain)** (after 1 year), the tax rate is 10%.

### Debt mutual funds.
-  The short term/long term bifurcation is done at 3 years in debt funds (as compared to 1 in equity mutual funds).
- The short term tax rate is same as your income slab rates (30% in my case), while for long term it's 20% (with indexation benefits)
- Debt mutual funds come with **indexation benefits** - which is a way to adjust the inflation rate into tax calculations.
- So if in 2005, you had 100$ invested in debt mutual funds, and after 5 years, you sell it for 200\$. Using the inflation index (link [here](https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/charts%20%20tables/cost-inflation-index.htm)), the actual value of 100\$ in 2010 is = 167/117*100 = 142\$. You are not taxed on `200$-100$` but `200$-142$`.
