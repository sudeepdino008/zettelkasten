# self expression


- In the book "Wisdom of the Enneagram", I found that my personality type was 5. And personality types 5 are concerned with self-expression. 
- I've found that to be true with my case. Self expression is indeed important to me and much of my effort and involvement is in becomign better to be able to have a vast reportoire of knowledge, and creatively express myself.
- It's frustrating when no progress is seen, and it's important to talk about it.
