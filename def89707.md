# self expression


- I believe I'm concerned with self-expression. It's confirmed by the book "Wisdom of the Enneagram"
- Self expression is indeed important to me and much of my effort and involvement is in becoming better to be able to have a vast reportoire of knowledge, and creatively express myself.
- It's frustrating when no progress is seen, and it's important to talk about it.
