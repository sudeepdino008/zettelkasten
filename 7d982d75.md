# Distrust the narrative mind?

- Can you identify few basic core principles and just ennsure that you're living upto that each day or every time you're gonna sit to work (that might be a better driving force than a narrative)
- Work in the present, following the core principles. The "story" takes care of itself.


# Arguments against it

- Stories are wonderful drives for humans. Sure, they go wacky, but trying to entirely eliminate it is silly.
