# Zettelkasten


## Ideas for organizing the material here

- For example, The chapter of **Art of Learning** can document all the various subsections and topics that can come under it, and then begins to branch out from there. 
This approach is more like adding information, rather than a continuation from existing notes as the ZettelKasten is supposed to be.
- There definitely will be a lot of information which doesn't fit directly as a continuation. That's expected.
- To have more continuation style notes, start looking at the topics, and see if you have any doubts about it or any curiosities you would like to follow. This exercise should help a lot.

- `Resources`:  
Do mention the link and resources. I can see it's highly useful in finding neighbour ideas or just digging the idea in more detail (a wikipedia link or a book reference etc.)

- `Zettelkasten is not a journalling medium`  
It's easy for the zettelkasten to become a confused space because it's treated like a journalling medium. Zettekasten is *not* a journalling space. It's a space for precise well baked thoughts to go in. If you want to nevertheless have something akin to journal, use the <9df1dfd7?cf> zettel. But before anything makes to the zettel, ensure it's well thought of and improves the knowledge of tree, rather than add needless ambiguity and vagueness.

- `A note on tags`  
Using a tag `explore-further` to mark those zettels which have topics of further exploration or pending questions.

- Tools:
  - Visual studio code + github integration is cool (foambubble)
  - trying [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/install.html) currently: Exploring it <d85ec130>
