# Doubt and Skepticism


## Nature of doubt

- Doubt exists to annihilate what it doubts.
- If it can't annihilate it, it dies unfulfilled.
- Doubt exists because of some specific reason that the belief is wrong.
- An uninvestigated doubt might as well not exist.

## How (and how not) to use doubt.

- Doubt and scepticism are important tools. But taking pride in them is ignorant and lazy. Don't celebrate because you merely doubted; But do rejoice if you manage to flip your belief starting from a thread of doubt.
- These are merely preclude to the fact that you don't know something, it's a possibility of becoming better. Systematic investigation has to start from here.
- Don't flaunt your ignorance. Yes, you don't know something. Now tell me what you'll do about it. 

## Motivation

- Yes, doubting is tough. Human brain is designed for confirmation bias, and not having to change your opinion a lot. But don't forget that an ideal mind is not afraid of doubt and in fact, it welcomes it.
