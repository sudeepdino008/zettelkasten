# Introduction to formal logic

#### resource
1. [forall X Calgary：An introduction to Formal Logic](http://forallx.openlogicproject.org/forallxyyc.pdf)


## the scope of logic
1. Arguments - A collection of premises, together with a conclusion.
2. Consequence: what sentence can follow what set of statements?   Arguments can be valid or invalid
3. inductive arguments: when previous observations or experiences are used to come up with general truths. (They're not sound arguments in formal logic)
4. nomonogically valid: there are no counterexamples that don't violate the laws of nature.
5. conceptually valid: if there are no counterexamples that don't violate conceptual connections between words.

## other logical notions
### joint possibility
sentences are jointly possible iff there is a case where they are all true together.

### necessary truths, necessary falsehoods and contingency
1. necessary truths  
For example: Either it is raining here, or it is not
2. necessary falsehood   
for example: It is both raining here and not raining here.
3. contingency: statements which can be true or false (depending on circumstances)  
for example: it is raining

### necessary equivalence
two statements have the same truth values no matter which case you consider.

## symbolization
### atomic sentences
```
A: It is raining outside
C: Jenny is miserable
```

### Connectives
```
not: ~
conjunction: ∧
disjunction: ∨
conditional：→
biconditional：↔
```
The above are basic ones. There are other connectives like 'unless' which can be derived from above.
```
unless A then B：~A → B
```

## sentences of the formal language (TFL)
Inductive definition：you specify some base elements, and some way to use base elements and previously created elements to create new ones.

## Ambiguity
lexical ambiguity：ambiguity of meaning  
structural ambiguity：the sentence can be interpreted in different ways. E.g. Flying planes can be dangerous.

In TFL, the aim is to avoid ambiguity.  
See the [case of Sir Roger Casement - Hanged by a comma](The case)

scope ambiguities：come from due to different interpretations of the scope of connectives.  
e.g. Send me a picture of a small and dangerous or stealth animal.

## Use and mention

### Quotation conventions
use vs mention：When you want to talk about the PM, we *use* his name. When we want to talk about the PM's name, we *mention* the name (which we do by putting quotation marks)  
```
use：Narendra Modi is the PM.
mention：'Narendra Modi' is composed of two words

wrong usage：Narendra Modi is composed of two words.
```

### Object language and Metalanguage
Object language is the formal language, whose statements might be mentioned in the metalanguage.  
Metalanguage might be extended to include 'metavariables', which are used to talk about the object language.  
e.g.：`α is a sentence, then ~α is a sentence.  `
α is not part of the object language, this is necessary because it allows us to 'metatalk' about the object language in general terms.
