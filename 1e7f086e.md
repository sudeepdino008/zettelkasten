# Zettelkasten features I want

- Should be easy to create and edit notes
- Should be able to use html tags for better editing
- Should have list of backlinks.
- Tag zettels (along with popup of existing tags to choose from when tagging a zettel)
- Graph rendering (or an eagle eye view of all zettels)
- 'Popup' windows when hovering over a link (like the one [here](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes))
- being able to see the path of notes to the currently open zettel.
