# ethics lags behind innovation

It's only after nuclear bombs were dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki that we thought about having peace treaties centered exclusively around not using nuclear bombs. Recently, you can see this in having regulations were social media; or carbon tax to disincentivize burning fuels.
More generally, we only started thinking about putting limits on a new technology with destructive potential once it's used in a devastating way.  
I wonder if there's some technology with much more destructive potential (example genetic engineering), begins to sweep us off earth's floor, and then it's too late for ethics to do damage control.
