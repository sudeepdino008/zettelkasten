# non-SHA256 Proof-of-Work

hash puzzle properties:
- difficult to compute 
- adjustable cost
- trivial to verify
- memoryless process

can we modify this to have the first 3 properties?

why would you want to do this?
- mining: most bitcoin users do not mine, as you need specialized hardware => Fight ASICs (ASIC resistance)

## ASIC resistance
- "disincentivize the use of custom-built hardware for mining"
- this will never be perfect - some hardware will always be better at mining than others
- there will always be incentive to make our own specialized hardware
- can we narrow the gap? Cryptos like Monero keep changing their PoW algorithm at some time intervals.

## Memory-hard vs memory-bound
- puzzle that requires lots of memory instead of lots of CPU power is memory-hard
- if time to access memory is limiting factor of computation, the puzzle is memory-bound
- e.g. sudoku of million to million size
- SHA-256 is neither memory-hard nor memory-bound

### scrypt
- similar to bitcoin's partial hash-preimage puzzle but with reliance on memory
- with buffer used: `O(n)` computations, without buffer: `O(n^2)` computations.

### cuckoo cycle
- build bipartite graph from transactions and find cycle of specific size
- difficult to cpmpute: yes; parameterizable: yes, increase number of nodes, size of cycle, or add restrictions to which edges are "valid"; trivial to verify? yes, easy to check if given cycle path; memoryless process? yes, just need to try different possibilities.

## is mining wasteful
- is mining wasteful? Can we use it for something better?
- Primecoin: first proof-of-useful work coins out there. Looking for Cunningham chains of primes. But how "useful" is this work.
  - a sequence of k prime numbers p1,p2,p3,...pn such that `pi=2pi-1 + 1`
  - there's conjecture that for any k there exists a cunningham chain of size k
- Golem: allows you to "rent out" computing power to perform lage-scale computing tasks.


## nonoutsourceable puzzles
- puzzles which disincentivize pools or collusion in general
- easiest solution: require all miners to know a private key


## proof of stake
- agreement on canonical history
- the idea is to make it difficult to harm the blockchain in any way. Proof of Work does this by making it difficult to manifacture blocks by using expensive computation.

![simple proof of stake](simple_proof_of_stake.png)
problems:
- chain splits are hard to deal with
- what happens if the miner nominated goes offline; a backup has to be selected, what if the original nominated comes back online; must know all the producers at any moment
- if everyone knows who the next block producer is, he might be DDoS'ed -> it should be difficult to know who's going to produce the next block: Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs)


- towards proof of stake: how to make it expensive to follow a non-canonical chain? Since producing blocks is cheap, there "nothing at stake" problem.
- you put some bond, which can be slashed if other producers realize that you're causing mishap.
- vulnerability: if they have majority of stake, they can override honest nodes.
- variations:
  - hybrid PoS: PoS + PoW
  - Delegated PoS
  - Nominated PoS
  - Ourobouros: used by Cardano
