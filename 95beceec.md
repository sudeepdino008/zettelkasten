# have it all

- Ambition: The drive to earn money, fame and "make it" in life has driven many 18-21 year woman to the porn industry. Even though they know that most of them will survive in the industry for only 3-6 months, they would rather consider themselves anomalies than part of the statistics. 
- The belief that all that you need to make it big is you yourself, the surroundings - life circumstances and skillset don't matter. Even though I would rather believe that I can do anything, having a very specific objective goal which is too big and doesn't take into account what you are or where you're starting, can have disastrous effects - Like those pornstars who are obsessed with making it big, even though it destroys them.
- This is an example of the "Western Self".
