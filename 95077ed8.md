# Setup the process and detach the ego

- Once you have multiple such projects defined and ready to go, track how much you're working on each as the weeks go by. 
- Are you picking too much, for example if you have some app development goals (and there are a lot of mini-projects/tutorials related to it), can you drop a few and pick the important ones. Refer to your overall goals to understand which projects have maximum alignment.
- Repeat the process day in and day out. It's about [[[d580fcc2]]].  You've given thought to what your most important goals are, you've setup projects which you know are aligned with them, and you're tracking progress and making sure that things are not slipping.   
This is the process, if you follow it, things will be good. If you don't, you might not achieve what you wanted. It's a simple equation. There's no place for ego here.
- Don't consider your motivations each and every day. Allow the results of the process to accumulate. Motivation will come and go, but it'll stick around much better if you keep at the method without motivation or passion as a prerequisite.
