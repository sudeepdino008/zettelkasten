# Projection Bias

This is a technical, human-decision-theory term for “short-sightedness”. When taking current decisions (which has future implications), we tend to project our current emotions to the future i.e. people’s estimations are contaminated by their current emotional state. For example, after a student fails his exams, ze is likely to underestimate how much ze will enjoy a party 3 weeks from the results.  
Projection bias can arise from empathy gaps - basically when a person fail to take the future psychological state into account. A similar concept is Personality neglect, which refers to a person’s tendency to overlook their personality when making decisions about future emotions.  
Projection bias influences the lifecycle of consumption. The immediate utility obtained from consuming the project exceeds the future utility. So people tend to consume too much early in life, and too little late in life, relative to what would be optimal.
