# Socially dictated ideal Self


- The ideal self you concoct depends majorly on the kind of society you live in. 
- You are presented with a range of choices - from clothes to political stance to the pool of potential partners and so on.
- The default behavior of brain is to accept the presented choices (unless it conflicts with your self-interest, in which case default is to reject). It's only afterwards that with conscious deliberation and effort we can revert our decisions.
- Regardless, this playing field of accepting and rejecting ideas has been already constructed by the society we live in.
- <43e65174> is one of the major influences our environment have on us - Not only do we look for the construction of the ideal self through stories (Bible, Gita, Tom Sawyer etc.), but we also look at flesh-and-bone living or once-living exemplars.
