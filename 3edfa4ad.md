# Tax Regimes: Stages of investment


EEE/EET etc. - 3 stages of investment - Fixed or Recurring Deposit are taxed at accrual stage at your tax slab, so a 6% interest rate actually becomes 4.2% in 30% slab (shite!). It's applicable if the interest is above Rs. 10k in a year - you can also get exemption on the principal by showing it under 80c (total should still be within 1.5l of course)
