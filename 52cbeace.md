# Hacking Darwin

Genetic revolution is inevitable. But *how* it plays out is anything but inevitable, and in important ways, up to us. The book is an effort to jump start the conversation of understanding what's happening, and what's at stake.

The conflict of the magnificent wonder and brutal cruelty of our own biology. We have a strong attraction towards what's natural, but at the same time we're defined by our efforts to tame nature. We want our children to be born healthy, but there is practically no limits on how far parents will go in defying nature to save their children from disease.

- sequencing genomes (along with the advancing powers of AI/ML) will help answer YES/NO or statistical probabilities of an on-dish embryo having a potential disease.
- coupled with in vitro fertilisation (IVF), parents will forego conception through sex because it can lead to a much greater probablity of developing diseases.  
People not using IVFs might be viewed in similar terms to how anti-vaxxers are viewed today.
- After this basic health care problem is resolved (by identifying how gene groups relates to certain diseases), we start to identify how gene sequences effect traits like height, intelligence, extroversion etc.  
It might so happen that these options are presented to the parents at time of IVF, and given that other parents might be utilizing this tech to allow maximum chances of survival and flourish for their children, reluctant parents will be inclined to do so too.
- nature vs nurture: Biology isn't everything. Your genetics can't determine if you'll have lung cancer (that depends on your lifestyle). But biology does play a significant role in many characteristics (studies done on twins separated at birth and re-united many years later have shown to have similar dispositions).  
Genetics go a long way in determining what diseases or dispositions you'll have, more so for factors like height or ENT issues. To that extent, we can probabilistically determine if this particular embryo will be tall or extroverted.
- It's not only about not selecting an embryo at all. Even if you select an embryo with some risk of, say, type 2 diabetes, you can look to inculcate the importance of good diet and exercise in your child's life.
