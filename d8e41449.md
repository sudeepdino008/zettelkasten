# (Avoid) Preening

- It's a seductive subset of <68a39091?cf>.
- It's low-impact, high-visibility work. 
- It's attractive because many companies conflate high-visibility and high-impact work so strongly that they can't distinguish between preening and impact.
- It's okay to preen if you're taking a short term look at career grown, and making use of current org's pathologies, go ahead and preen gloriously.
- But this probably won't have a lot of growth of intrinsic self-growth. Because your priorities have shifted ("what's most shiny?") you tend to lose focus of "what's most important?"
- It's also an important factor to consider when choosing a company to work at.
