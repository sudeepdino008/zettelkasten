# Rust: Collections

## vector


basic statement: immutable and imutable borrow should not occur in the same scope. The values get allocated on the heap (even struct, which idependently gets allocated on stack)

this is fine:
```rust
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = &v[0]; //immutable borrow
    println!("The first element is: {}", first); //immutable borrow used
    v.push(6);         // mutable borrow
```

this results in failure:
```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let first = &v[0]; //immutable borrow
v.push(6);      //mutable borrow. Fail!
println!("The first element is: {}", first);  //immutable borrow used here
// if the above line is commented out, "first" goes out of scope in 2nd line itself, and 
// is therefore fine
```


## Strings
- implemented as a collection of bytes
- `str` - owner, mutable, growable, UTF-8 encoded string type is the only string representation in core rust
- there are other String types which represent the data in memory in different way or different encodings. For example: `CString`, `OsString`

- as it's UTF-8 encoded, any properly encoded format can be put into it.
- creation: `"hello".to_string()` or `String::from("hello")`

```rust
// String is stored in heap

    let s = &String::from("foo");
    println!("value is {}", s);
    println!("value is {:p}", s);  // address of String in heap
    println!("value is {:p}", &s); // address of s's location
```

- String is UTF-8 encoded, which means it uses variable number of bytes to represent characters across different languages, symbols etc. Also String is build on top of `Vec<u8>`, so it makes no sense to ask for the first byte of the string. `s[0]` will give first byte, but that might not be the first letter of the string.

- letters such as Russian, are represented in 2 bytes in UTF-8. So string indexing gives a compile type error.
- string slicing might be tricky too if you're looking at languages apart from english (for similar reasons as indexing). So need to be careful here.
- There are 3 relevant ways to look at strings in Rust: bytes, scalar values, grapheme clusters (closest things to letter)
