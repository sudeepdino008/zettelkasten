# Cryptocurrency: Smart contracts

one way to look at blockchain is as a state transition machine where every transaction changes the state.

The state transition function (STF) limits various kind of transactions possible e.g. sending unsigned transaction.

blockchain = repeated STF calls

"extrapolate": in blockchain, state is usually just account balances, but it can be complex, as well as the STF.

smart contract: developers can write their own code (on top of STFs and complex state) and deploy to the network.


## Ethereum
Ethereum Virtual Machine: users write in a high-level language which compiles down to EVM bytecode. Smart contracts are executed on every node.  
Solidity is turning complete, so there's possibility of things like infinite loops. In general, a class of malicious intent can be mitigated by "gas". It also makes people wary of running tooo many things on blockchain. If call runs out of gas during execution, state reverts (and caller has wasted gas).  
Gas (or weight in other blockchains) is imposed on storage, computation and even network packet sizes.
