## Confidence

- Relationships can be of two types - hierarchical or horizontal. 
- In hierarchical relationships, you consider someone to be higher or lower than you. 
- Hierarchical relationships are false games - The notion that there's levels of importance, and each individual is assigned some level depending on ability, age, money, wisdom etc.
- Even if you consider yourself to be at the top, there's pressure to stay there. While if you place others above you, there's lots of anxiety as you seek to overcome your position and move ahead. It's a game you can't win.
- True Confidence can never be a product of comparison. It's only a product of indifference. Realize that nothing truly matters in life, for you are a fleeting existence.
- If you really wish to do something, do it for the sake of **experiencing** it and not for "meaning" and "purpose" - which are constructions in your brain.
- People want to be applauded or thought highly of. But this often renders them actors on stage, playing a role to garner attention and praise. If you are indifferent, confidence will not be an issue.

## A contrary view on success

Success can be viewed as a self-created drama. Now humans feel that nothing worthwhile can be achieved without struggle. There are many things apart from a struggle which'll give you what you're struggling for.  
A person can choose the mindset of success, if he wishes to take a path of hard work and striving. This person is more interested in "struggle". People are interested in this path precisely because stuggle is a romanticised notion. It's "heroic".  
The other way is via the path of mastery. It's still an intense path, but peaceful. Closely linked to this idea is that of curiosity (<0d3bb863>). Hard work and struggle are for those who try to become that which they believe is difficult for them to attain.


## Which direction to go?
- What if I stop thinking too much into success and money, and instead try to optimise on better features like curiosity, contribution and experience?
- What does the above mean? It means that you ask questions, hunt for them, look at what's interesting about them.
