# Emacs : Hooks and advices


## Hooks

A lisp variable holding a list of functions, to be called on some well-defined occasion 
(called running a hook). Most hooks are *normal* hooks, meaning they don't need any arguments.
These end with '-hook'.

Then there are *abnormal* hooks. These are abnormal because they might expect an argument, or
their return value is used in some way.

You can use `setq` to, but the recommended way to do it is via `add-hook`. Most major modes run 
the mode hooks as the last step of the initialization. They're therefore a convenient way
to customize a major mode.

For example:
```
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'auto-fill-mode)
(add-hook 'latex-mode-hook (lambda () (auto-fill-mode -1)))

```

Major modes often *derive* from other major modes. For instance, HTML mode is derived 
from text-mode. When HTML mode is enabled, it runs text-mode-hook before running
html-mode-hook. This hierarchy of hooks allows a single hook to influence several mode.

## Advices

Just like hooks allow you to add steps at the end of mode init, advices allow you to augment functionalities of an existing function.
