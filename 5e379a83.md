# Rust: Module System

comprises of packages, crates, modules, paths.

- Package is a collection of crates. It should have atmost one library crate, and any number of binary crates. Overally there should be atleast one crate.

## Crates
- can be either binary or library. It's basically a tree of modules.
- there's a root module called crate, from which modules can branch out. This is similar to a filesystem.


## Modules
- organise code within a crate
- modules are how privacy boundaries is implemented in rust
- modules can contain more modules, structs, enums and other items.

## paths
- can be relative or absolute. Which one to use depends on if the used module and calling module would be refactored together in the future (keeping relative path intact) or if the the used module has a stable and fixed path (it's absolute path is intact).
- "super", "self" keywords can be used for navigation as well.
- one can rexport a path (using `pub` keyword) to expose some internal function publically outside.


```rust
#![allow(unused_imports)]
#![allow(dead_code)]

fn main() {
    use crate::book_store::customers::customer_support as cs;  // as keyword
    use book_store::{staff, customers::customer_support};  // nested paths
    pub use self::book_store::deliveryguys; // rexporting to users of current module
    use self::book_store::owners::*; // glob operator -> import all public items from path
    cs::inventory_fetch();
}


mod book_store {
    mod bookinventory {
        pub fn get_top_100() {
            println!("reached here");
        }
    }

    pub mod staff {
        fn amazingstaff() {
            println!("ther're here!");
        }
    }

    pub mod deliveryguys {}

    pub mod owners {
        pub mod owner {}
        mod investor {}
    }
    
    pub mod customers {
        pub mod customer_support {
            pub fn inventory_fetch() {
                super::super::bookinventory::get_top_100();
            }
        }

        mod customer {}
    }
}

```
