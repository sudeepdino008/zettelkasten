# Blockchain as a platform

- bitcoin is:
  - append-only log which stores data permanently
  - timestamping service: prove that one block occurs after another
  - means for value transfer
  - way to cryptographically commit information
  - a way to prove "identity"
- **can any of these features be used to do anything beside money?**

## secure timestamping with bitcoin
- proving that you know a block hash shows that the event occured after that block - computationally infeasible to know block hashes ahead of time.
- "proof of life" by Vitalik Buterin

## commitment scheme
- collision resistant and preimage resistant
- thus we can use our commitment scheme to commit to messages in the blockchain at a specific (+/- 2 hours) time.

## permanently storing data
- every full node has reasons to maintain the copies permanently (until bitcoin becomes unprofitable)
- by using OP_RETURN, can store up to 80 bytes of arbitrary data. This is controversial, some argue this is cheating and ethereum specifically discourages this through their design.
- though there have been arguments that if a person is willing to pay for the space, he/she should be able to use the space.
- other cryptos like bitcoin cv revel in the fact that they can store arbitrary data.
- this might be problematic for people running bitcoin.

### illicit content attack
- no one is stopping pushing arbitrary data onto the blockchain. There have been wedding images, wikileaks dump, hong kong protests articles protest, obscene image.


## smart property
- bitcoin doesn't represent anything...unless we all came to a consensus on what they represent.
- For example, ownership of certain tokens on ethereum could mean you own a NFT!
- in bitcoin, a particular UTXO can be associated with the ownership of something. UTXO can be used in a transaction to transfer ownership.
- perfect traceability!
- can represent securities (stocks, bounds); physical property tokens (real estate, vehicles); virtual property tokens (cryptokitties, domain names)

### fungibility
- UTXOs are not fungible - one UTXO is NOT like another: We can trace a UTXO all the way back to when it was mined from a block reward.
- benefit: smart properties
- drawbacks: Tracibility means anonymity is compromised. For example, people are reserved about buying "dirty" bitcoin which came from Mt. Gox hack.
- It's a spectrum though - Monero is non-traceable and therefore fungible. Different ways to slide that bar across fungibility spectrum.

## Bitcoin as a platform

### overlay currencies
- overlay currencies: uses the underlying bitcoin, but some specific bitcoins are marked and can be re-used for non-bitcoin purposes.
- Colored coins is an extension of this idea - some metadata is added to a particular UTXO (called color, which is just a sequence of bits).
- security of bitcoin; but additional functionality for tracking property or other information.


## oracles 
- also called data feed: inject external data into blockchain.
- oracle problem: how do we trust data coming in from off the blockchain?

---
## Blockchain applications
- what are people actually doing with blockchain?
  - gambling
  - smart contracts: runs on blockchain; anyone can verify that the contract ran correctly; anyone can look at the code and see what'll happen if it runs (trust)
  - prediction markets: betting events - weather, political elections, sports events; oracle problems - can be used as a way to actually ssee what happens in the future (as people with resources and knowledge are betting)
  - assasination markets: WTF!?
  - BAT tokens: for watchign privacy respecting ads; you can make payments to websites you like using BAT tokens.
  - cryptokitties: first NFTs; breeding kitties (games)
  - DeFi: crypt-collateralized loans - crypto as collateral  
    Automatic Market Maker
  - algorithmic stablecoins
  - exchanges: ERC-20 - a standard to create overlay currencies 
- what could be done with blockchain applications?


### Automatic market makers
- it's a kind of exchange, but not with traditional buyers and sellers listing/buying assets.
- AMM have pools of several tokens, say BTC and ETH. Their values relative to each other is determined by mathematical aformulas. A simple one is one proposed by Buterin: `BTC_balance(p) * ETH_balance(p)=k` where `k` is a constant. If one ETH is bought, the price of ETH goes up, while BTC goes down. If one ETH is added to the pool, the reverse happens. 
- AMMs are usually configured to reflect accurate market prices, adn if they venture too far from market price, the model incentivizes users to take advantage of it.
