# It's a bad idea to feel guilty for magically abandoning behavioral patterns we dislike 

Many people feel guilty for failing to work until they drop every single day; Or when failing to magically abandon behavioral patterns they dislike. People feel guilty about these patterns as if they had complete dominion over their mind. As if these patterns were not baked in to the mind, or as if brain was not a network of neurons. As if they could choose their preferred choice instead of follow where the patterns drive you. As if they could choose their minds, instead of be their minds.  
You don't need to berate yourself when you fail to act exactly as you wished to act. That only happens after tweaking the environment, noticing your mistakes, and training your brain.  
> If you keep doing the same things, you are going to get the same results.

The things we're trying to do is pretty hard. So when you fail--Assist, don't badger. Help yourself practice to overcome those unwanted patterns; assist to execute the next clever plan on your list.  
One day we might gain more control over our minds, and be able to choose the cognitive patterns we want. One day, we might be more like creatures we wish we were like. But today we're not. Today, we're not gods. We're still monkeys.
