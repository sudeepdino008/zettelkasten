# Dim Satisfaction

It's easy to recognize that you're not putting effort towards your goals if you're sitting on the couch.  
It's very easy to convince yourself that you're doing your best (or enough) with a little bit of effort.   
Complacency can set in easily. Dim satisfaction is a proxy for contentment arising from true mastery. Do not pat yourself on the back for today's work, move on.
