# top-heavy attack plan

I've been susceptible to procrastinating my projects till the very end, and look to complete major chunks of it towards the end of the deadline or day. Start your day and try to finish off major chunks of it early, so that even if you settle into a mellow pace later on, you are cruising. Similarly, when starting a multi-week project, start with an aggressive pace and then mellow down. 
  - It helps you be more comfortable during the mid and later stages of the project.
  - You strike and strike hard when you have the most energy
  - You chart of the territory much earlier in the project, so there's less uncertainty and unknowns towards the end.


The downsides of having too much work clogged in the end is immense. You do poor work, you're not thorough, you don't get time to fix small bugs or think of ways to improving it.
