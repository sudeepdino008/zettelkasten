# Always be a student

- looking for feedback - harsh and critical is an art and a discipline. It's a necessary antidote to being puffed up by ego. Actively solicit it, and labor to seek negative feedback out precisely when family and friends are telling that you're doing great.
- "When the student is ready, the teacher appears"
