# Rust: Functional Programming features

- memoization: a struct holding closure and lazily alloted value from it (optional).
- Closure types implement `Fn` trait.
- closures can also capture environment parameters in the same ways via which function take parameters.
- `FnOnce`: taking ownership; `FnMut`: mutable borrow; `Fn`: borrow
- `move` keyword is used to take ownership in closures
- traits implemented by closure types are decided by what closure does with captured value, not how it captures them. `move` specifies only the latter.


**closure definitions**
```rust

pub fn closure_defs() {
    // closure: |i32, i32| -> i32
    let closure = |num1, num2| {
        println!("sleeping before work");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
        num2
    };

    // brackets optional for single statement
    let single_statement_closure = |num| num;

    let a = 1;
    if a == 2 {
        closure(23, 34);
    } else {
        println!("{}", single_statement_closure(2));
    }
}

```


**memoizer implementation**
```rust
pub fn memoization_fn() {
    struct Cacher<T, Inp, Out>
    where
        T: Fn(Inp) -> Out,
        Inp: Eq + Hash + Copy,
        Out: Copy,
    {
        calculation: T,
        value: HashMap<Inp, Out>,
    }

    impl<T, Inp, Out> Cacher<T, Inp, Out>
    where
        T: Fn(Inp) -> Out,
        Inp: Eq + Hash + Copy,
        Out: Copy,
    {
        pub fn new(calculation: T) -> Cacher<T, Inp, Out> {
            Cacher {
                calculation,
                value: HashMap::new(),
            }
        }

        pub fn get_value(&mut self, key: Inp) -> Out {
            if self.value.contains_key(&key) {
                return *self.value.get(&key).expect("not found");
            }

            self.value.insert(key, (self.calculation)(key));
            self.get_value(key)
        }
    }

    let calculation = |i: u32| i + 1;

    let mut cacher = Cacher::new(calculation);

    println!("{}", cacher.get_value(3));
    println!("{}", cacher.get_value(4));

    let mut cacher = Cacher::new(|val: &str| "GG");
    println!("{}", cacher.get_value("a"));
    println!("{}", cacher.get_value("b"));
    println!("{}", cacher.get_value(&String::from("b")));
}

```


**what's the Fn type of the closure here**
```rust

pub fn moving_and_fn() {
    let x = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let equal_to_x = |y| x == y;
    println!("can use x here {:?}", x);
    let y = vec![1, 2, 3];
    assert!(equal_to_x(y));
    println!(
        "can use x here too {:?}, as only immutable borrow has occured",
        x
    );
}

```



## Iterators
- iterator adapters: convert on kind of interator to another e.g: map
- since iterators use closure, they capture their environment
- zero cost abstractions (and are infact often fast than the loop counterparts)
