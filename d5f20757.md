# Rust: Ownership

Ownership: Managing heap data  
- Rust uses something similar to RAII where a "drop" is added at the end of the function (or when it goes out of scope) to release the heap memory used.
- String literal is allocated on stack (as it's fixed size) whereas String is allocated on heap.
```rust
let s = String::from("hello");  //"hello" is a string literal
```
- Types with **Drop** annotation have reference to some data in the heap. Move semantics are used in assignment, function calls or function returns.
```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
// s1 is no longer valid here, using it will return in error
// the ownership of the heap data storing the string is now with s2.
// this avoids the "double free" problem
```

- Copy trait: performs a shallow copy i.e. only data in stack is copied.
  - Simply copies the bytes pointed to be the variable. The underlying principle is that stack only data is easy to recreate, so there's no reason to do ownership transfer.
  - So if a class implements Copy trait with a reference to a String, "copy" will simply copy the reference of the String into the new Class instance. The heap data won't be copied.
  - It's different from the move semantics in that the earlier variable is still valid.
  - Note that this could lead to "double drop" problem, so a type cannot be annotated by Copy trait if it already is annotated by Drop.
  - Some types that do implement copy are: scalar types and tuples composed solely of scalar types.

- Clone trait: explicit function which needs to be defined by the user. Might be used to do a deep clone. This will be expensive.

- Stack unwinding: The stack variables are popped off the stack in the reverse order to which they were added.


## References and borrowing

- Ownership transfer in function calls can be inconvenient. We need to return the variable to transfer back the ownership, this is not a good solution.  
- Instead, you can "borrow" - have function parameters as references instead of transferring ownership.
- references is a way to refer to a data without taking ownership of it.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

**Mutable reference**: you need to create mutable reference if the function intends to change the underlying data. Rust also handles data races by the following restriction - you cannot have a immutable reference and a mutable reference in the same scope. Oh, and data races can happen when these 3 behaviour occur:
- two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
- one of them is being used to edit/write the data
- there's no synchronization for accessing the data.


```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // r1 and r2 are no longer used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{}", r3);
}

```

Dangling references: a pointer that references a location in memory, but that location has already been freed. In rust, the compiler guarantees that there won't be any dangling references.  
For example, this would lead to error:

```rust
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new string

    &s // a reference to s is returned here
}  // s goes out of scope, freeing the memory. 
// Any reference to the pointer returned here 
// will lead to dangling pointer error. DANGER!
```


## The Slice Type
- lets you refer to a contiguous sequence of elements of a collection (rather than the whole collection). It does not take ownership of the collection of sliced subcollection.
- a slice internally stores a reference to the first element and the length of the slice.

### String slice
refers to a part of a String, and it looks like this:
```rust
let s = String::from("hello world");

let hello = &s[0..5];
let world = &s[6..11];
```
- The type of string slice is `&str`
- btw, string literals are also slices
```rust

fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s); // immutable borrow happens here 

    s.clear(); // error!  // mutable borrow occurs here

    println!("the first word is: {}", word); // immutable borrow later used here
}

fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```
- oh, the cool thing is rust can detect the String from which the slice is created (which causes immutable borrow). So it's not like for any slice (even if it's not linked to a String reference) will throw error. It's only if immutable and mutable bottow happens on the same String, will the error be thrown. Consider this example:

```rust

fn main() {
    ownership();
}

fn ownership() {
    // slices
    let mut a = String::from("hwllo owld");
    let mut b = String::from("mimi");
    let word = get_something(&a, &b);
    a.clear();
    println!("value: {}", word);
}
// the given signature fails: we've to use lifetime parameter 
// to specify if the borrowed value returned is borrowed 
// from s or s1. Right now, it's not clear.
fn get_something(s: &String, s1: &String) -> &str {  
    let bytes = s1.as_bytes();
    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s1[..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}

```

### array slices

```rust

#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let slice = &a[1..3];
}

```

Ownership explorations and examples

```rust
let s2 = &String::from("b");
let s4 = *s2 + "d";
```

Here s2 is a borrowed reference, so it cannot be dereferenced ('+' operator takes ownership of first parameter) and ownership transerred. A real life example is: I borrow notes from you, promising to return it. But then pass these notes onto some other friend who runs away with it. This is stupid and rust blocks you from doing this.   
There are 2 solutions here:
- make String or whatever type implement the Copy trait: basically you're copying the notes and then passing to your friend.
- use reference borrowing again to concatenate s2 and "d": you're passing notes to your friend, who makes the promise that he'll return it back to you.
