## Environment model of evaluation
needs to replace the substitution model when the values of the variable can change over time, so simple substitution doesn't work. You need to have an environment which bounds variables to values.  
The two key things that this model explains is:
- Why procedures/variables with same name but different scope not conflict with each other. This is because of the hierarchy model of environment (tree like), and each procedure is executed in a root environment.
- How local procedures can capture free variables from enclosing procedures.




## Message passing

## Metacircular evaluator
An evaluator that's written in the same language as the one it's evaluating.  
We use this evaluator (written in lisp) to evaluate lisp itself. It looks to progressively break lisp instructions until it reaches some base rules or terminating conditions (or primitive expressions, compared to special forms) like quoted expression or value lookup from the environment.  
The core of the evaluator banks on the interplay between eval and apply.  
eval: takes procedure and environment, then classifies it for the purpose of directing its execution. The base rules are present here (except primitive procedure execution, which is done by apply)  
apply: this applies some primitive procedure, or unwraps a compound procedure by first creating a new environment and then eval'ing it.

Representing expressions: eval utilizes abstract functions which allows it to play with the components of expression. For each expression, it needs a check which can qualify the type of the expression. Then it needs certain type specific component functions, which allows it to extract components of the particular expression.
```scheme
(define (quoted? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'quote))
(define (text-of-quotation exp) (cadr exp))
```
Derived expressions: Certain expressions (like cond) can be represented in terms of other expressions (like if).

evaluator data structures: Another thing our metacircular evaluator needs is internal data structures which it can modify and use (like representation of true and false; or representation of environment)


Dispatching on type: Checking the type of the datum and calling the appropriate procedure. Might need to know about the different datum types, and what procedure needs to be called etc.  
data-directed programming: A new representation has to "register" itself, and the central dispatching unit uses the registry to find out the appropriate procedure to dispatch on.




## Streams: as an alternate to modeling state
map, filter, accumulate, enumerate are powerful abstractions that allows one to modify sequences. However, these abstractions have to store intermediate lists which can be expensive. Imperative style programming doesn't have this limitation, since it can enumerate and perform operations on the elements at the same time, this eliminating the need for large intermediate storage.  
With streams (and delayed evaluation) we achieve the best of both the worlds - we have the elegant sequence modifying operations, along with the efficiency of incremental computation.  
Works on delay and force.  
streams allows to do some interesting tricks. For example: Sequence accelerator. Once you have a stream of approximations, you can construct a second stream from the previous approximate stream. Only that the second stream converges (to pie or e or whatever) faster. This can be applied again and again to create a stream of streams, a structure known as tableau.  

Exploiting the stream paradigm:
- Formulating iterations as stream processes: time series calculations; euler's transform (sequence accelerator) ; tableau structures
- Infinite streams of pairs: stream of integer pairs on the basis of a weight function; finding ramanujan numbers (a number which can be represented as sum of cubes of two numbers, in 2 different ways)
- Modelling streams as signals: current changing with time or any feedback to the system can be modelled as streams

The streams seem to have the same modularity which modeling state achieves (state variables). Although it would need more examples to believe that.  
So each stream output can take multiple inputs (which is apparent in solution to 3.82). It can also output multiple variables (using cons as a means to combine).

Cost of introducing assignment: You lose referential transparency. In languages like JAVA you often have to be careful when you are sharing your members to outside entities--It can lead to uninformed modification which in turn effects the original object's state adversely. The programming mandate of "Keep all the members of your class as final or read-only" is there for a reason. At other places people go around this by returning copy of the member when someone "gets" it.  
Another cost is that in imperative programming, the order of statements has to be considered closely, flipping the order of statements can lead to subtle bugs.
Another cost is synchronization issues in concurrent systems

Although the time problem can come in streams as well, particularly when we're trying to model an interaction of independent entities (like the joint account example, where there are two separate streams of withdrawals and you need to merge both).



## Non-deterministic programs
The advantage of nondeterministic programming is that we can suppress the details of how search is carried out, thereby expressing our programs at a higher level of abstraction.
