# Learning

## Tree of knowledge
- Most important is to learn the fundamentals. When you place a piece of information, it should be hanged to one of the existing branches of the tree. Covering the fundamentals sets you  up to learn anything based on it. Keep your fundamentals strong, keep revising it. You should be ready to talk about it to an audience at anytime.
- When learning a fundamental, it's possible that  you  can't do it in a single day. So the first thing is to carve out the skeleton of the fundamental theory, what are the set of topics that will cover your fundamentals. Then add the flesh with time.


## Stamina and Long hours
- **Sprint and Relax**  
The  idea  is intense  focus for some time followed by "recovery" or letting  it  go. This can be in between the game itself, You  come back with renewed energy. The better you're  at recovery, the  better endurance you have.  
The key idea when relaxing is to let the activity really go; roam around and soak in the environment, be present and soak what's there. Let the mind wander.
The same concept can be applied in cardio workouts - cycle for 10 minutes till that bmp is 175, then relax for 60 seconds (till you get to  145 bmp); Then try to shrink the relaxation period shorter and shorter.

- I've found that meditation really helps me recharge and be on for some serious work in evening even though I've worked the whole day before.
