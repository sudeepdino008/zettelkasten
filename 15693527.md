# Learning

## Overview / Summary
- look for the uncomfortable zones - work towards mastering them, that's where the growth happens
- build knowledge in the form of tree
	- first, build the skeleton
	- second, lay out the root and trunk
	- third, link back new information to the fundamentals. 
	- fourth, revise the previous entries periodically
- sprint and rest
- soft zones
- find ways to manage your energy: breathing exercises, past experiences, shower, exercise, desire for mastery.


## Tree of knowledge
1. The first thing to do is to **build the skeleton first** and then progressively build your knowledge by adding flesh to the skeleton. Map out the territory, then begin adding the flesh. Do not miss this step. This also becomes important when learning the fundamentals can span over day, so it helps to have the map of territory and see what is the next thing to cover.
	- for building the skeleton, it's useful to think about the domain as broadly as possible. The following is a checklist of items you can use to construct the skeleton--: 
		- Sources which contain good **overview** (like wikipedia, review articles, oxford handbooks, beginner video series like khan academy); apart from the overview of subject matter, you want to look at the key studies or frameworks, an overview of open and solved problems in the field
		- turning to your own curiosity about **how** things work, why it's awesome (**optimist**), and what are the criticisms (**play the devil's advocate**)
		- much later, when you have a firm ground (or think so), **explaining the concept** to other sensible grounded people, might expose some obvious questions and gaps.
		- **getting your hands dirty** wherever possible is always a good way to get more flavour about the domain and not have knowledge just budding in your head.
- When building the tree of knowledge, it's important to cover the **root and trunk second**. If you walk away from the topic, you should atleast have the fundamentals covered. Details don't matter when you're dabbling. This is the 80/20 of knowledge. 
  So in zettelkasten, pay more focus on documenting the fundamentals stuff. It's okay to eliminate some information here and there too. For example, when zetteling django web framework, you can just document the features there rather than noting the steps to add a new Model [these can always be found easily with a google search].
- Here's an idea which might be a framework update to TOK: When you come across a new piece of info, think about how it **links back to the fundamentals** (or trunk/roots of the tree). This might reveal some gaps in the path, which can help complete the skeleton or intermediate details.
- When starting to read a new book, **revise the previous entries** on that topic. Ensure that you have a clear picture of what the existing tree looks like. This is specially important when you're resuming the topic after a break.


## Stamina and Long hours
### Sprint and Relax  
- The  idea  is intense  focus for some time followed by "recovery" or letting  it  go. This can be in between the game itself, You  come back with renewed energy. The better you're  at recovery, the  better endurance you have.  
- The key idea when relaxing is to let the activity really go; roam around and soak in the environment, be present and soak what's there. Let the mind wander.
- The same concept can be applied in cardio workouts - cycle for 10 minutes till that bmp is 175, then relax for 60 seconds (till you get to  145 bmp); Then try to shrink the relaxation period shorter and shorter.
- I've found that meditation really helps me recharge and be on for some serious work in evening even though I've worked the whole day before.


### Depth vs Breadth
- When wanting to learn a domain, we come across the need for both depth study and breadth exploration.
- Depth is needed to slowly gain expertise, building the foundations. While breadth is needed to get the bird's eye view, develop motivation or confidence in the domain.
- One way to manage this is to allocate fix time for depth study, and then have a more relaxed breadth exploration later on (preferably with lesser energy or focus, and lesser time).
