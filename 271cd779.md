# Work on what matters

As you grow in your career, you'll have to have more and more impact in less and less time. The ledge gets narrower, but remains walkable.

## Things to avoid

## Work where there's room and attention

- Be aware of focusing your efforts in a place where everyone is already invested.
- The most effective places to work are those that matter to your company but still have enough room to actually work. 
- Some examples are: Priorities which can become important in future (and can you do them ahead of time?). What areas are doing okay, but can do _great_ with your support.
- Sometimes you will find work that's worthy of attention, but the leadership doesn't value that work. For example: developer tooling.
- Sometimes an area that an organization doesn't pay attention to is so important that you're going to want to advocate for more attention on it. This is one of the most tough jobs.

## Finish Things

- close things which somehow doesn't seem to close out.

## What only you can

- The final category of work is the sort that you're _uniquely_ capable of accomplishing. Maybe you are faster or better at it, but much more important is the sort of work that simply won't happen if you don't do it.
