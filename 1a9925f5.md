# Emacs

Reference : [Emacs lisp ref](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html#SEC_Contents)

## variables

- use `setq` for global variables 
- keywords are prefixed by `:` and never change, for example `:hello`
```lisp
;; if something is a keyword
(keywordp :hello) => t

;; defconst -> inform the user that you do not intend to change the value, however it's not enforced
```


## Buffers

```lisp

M-x buffer-menu   ;; begin editing a buffer listing of all emacs buffer
M-x buffer-menu-other-window ;; similar, but do in another window

C-x C-b should be set to buffer-menu-other-window
```

- In the *Buffer List*, you can delete buffer (`d`), and then execute (`x`) etc. Just like dired mode.
- To open a buffer do `o` (takes pointer to that buffer) or `C-o` (keeps pointer in buffer list)


`1` : Select this line's buffer in a full-frame window
`2` : Set up two windows on the current frame, with this line's buffer selected in one, and a previously current buffer (aside from *Buffer List*) in the other


- Each buffer has information associated with it like what file it's visiting, major/minor modes. These are stored in *buffer-local variables*


## Files

Use Emacs bookmarks to well, bookmark frequently used files:
Add: `C-x r m`
List: `C-x r l`

commands for opening buffers (from buffer lists) are shared in bookmarks list too.


## Dired mode

- `+` create directory
- `z` compress directory
- `c` copy file
- `m` mark file

## Kill ring
`C-c C-c`

## Truth and falsehood in emacs lisp

`nil` essentially evaluates to false, everything else is true. Note that `nil` has 2 meanings - empty list ( `nil` or `()` ) or false.

## Conditional statements in emacs lisp

1. **When**: If condition is true, evaluate all statements
```emacs lisp
(when <condition>
      <statement1>
      <statement2>
      ...
      <statementn>)
```
