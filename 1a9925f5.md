# Emacs

Reference : [Emacs lisp ref](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html#SEC_Contents)

## <29e52495>

## Faster loading

- Use emacsclient
- In terminal, don't kill the emacs. Use `Ctrl-Z` to put it in background, and `fg` to move it to foreground again.

## variables

- `set` and `setq` \
use `setq` for global variables 
```emacs lisp
(set 'fname "Sudeep") â©¸ (setq fname "Sudeep")

;; `setq` can take multiple values

(setq fname "Sudeep" lname "Kumar") ;; returns the last value set
```

- keywords are prefixed by `:` and never change, for example `:hello`
```lisp
;; if something is a keyword
(keywordp :hello) => t

;; defconst -> inform the user that you do not intend to change the value, however it's not enforced
```

- [Free variable](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FreeVariable)
This is a variable without a defvar, causing dynamic binding to possibly pollute the variable's value. The warning you get is - `assignment to free variable`

## Hooks

A lisp variable holding a list of functions, to be called on some well-defined occasion 
(called running a hook). Most hooks are *normal* hooks, meaning they don't need any arguments.
These end with '-hook'.

Then there are *abnormal* hooks. These are abnormal because they might expect an argument, or
their return value is used in some way.

You can use `setq` to, but the recommended way to do it is via `add-hook`. Most major modes run 
the mode hooks as the last step of the initialization. They're therefore a convenient way
to customize a major mode.

For example:
```
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'auto-fill-mode)
(add-hook 'latex-mode-hook (lambda () (auto-fill-mode -1)))

```

Major modes often *derive* from other major modes. For instance, HTML mode is derived 
from text-mode. When HTML mode is enabled, it runs text-mode-hook before running
html-mode-hook. This hierarchy of hooks allows a single hook to influence several mode.

## Advices

Just like hooks allow you to add steps at the end of mode init, advices allow you to augment functionalities of an existing function.

## Buffers

```lisp

M-x buffer-menu   ;; begin editing a buffer listing of all emacs buffer
M-x buffer-menu-other-window ;; similar, but do in another window

C-x C-b should be set to buffer-menu-other-window
```

- In the *Buffer List*, you can delete buffer (`d`), and then execute (`x`) etc. Just like dired mode.
- To open a buffer do `o` (takes pointer to that buffer) or `C-o` (keeps pointer in buffer list)


`1` : Select this line's buffer in a full-frame window
`2` : Set up two windows on the current frame, with this line's buffer selected in one, and a previously current buffer (aside from *Buffer List*) in the other


- Each buffer has information associated with it like what file it's visiting, major/minor modes. These are stored in *buffer-local variables*


## Files

Bookmark frequently used files:
Add: `C-x r m`
List: `C-x r l`

commands for opening buffers (from buffer lists) are shared in bookmarks list too.


## Dired mode

- `+` create directory
- `z` compress directory
- `c` copy file
- `m` mark file

## Kill ring
`C-c C-c`

## Truth and falsehood in emacs lisp

`nil` essentially evaluates to false, everything else is true. Note that `nil` has 2 meanings - empty list ( `nil` or `()` ) or false.

## Conditional statements in emacs lisp

1. #### When: If condition is true, evaluate all statements
```emacs lisp
(when <condition>
      <statement1>
      <statement2>
      ...
      <statementn>)
```
2. #### and: if all are true, returns the last true value; else return nil
```emacs lisp
(and 'a 'b 'c) => c
(and 'a nil 'c) => nil
```

3. #### if: returns the value of last executed statement
```emacs lisp
(if condition 
    then-statement
    else-statement1
    else-statement2
    ...)

```

4. #### cond: returns the first true condition
```emacs lisp
(setq value 6)
(cond ((> value 10) "greater than 10")
      ((> value 5) "greater than 5")
      ("less than 5"))
```



## Emacs lisp

### Reference: https://www.fincher.org/tips/Languages/Emacs.shtml

1. simpler than common lisp. But an optional extensions file, `c.el` contains many common lisp features.
2. list operations: 
   - **car, cons, cdr, list, append**
   ```
   ;; nthcdr : returns the 'nth' cdr
   
   (setq lis '(a b c d e))
   (nthcdr 2 lis)
   ;; (c d e)
   
   (nth 2 lis)
   ;; c
   
   ```
    - **map, apply, sort**
    ```
    (mapcar 'length '((a) (a b) (a b c)))
    (1 2 3)
    
    (apply 'max '(3 6 1)) => 6
    ```
3. Checks

```emacs lisp
(numperp 5) => t
(atom '(a b)) => nil
(null nil) => t
(bolp) => is point at the beginning of a line
(eolp) => is point at the end       of a line
(bobp) => is point at the beginning of a buffer
(eobp) => is point at the end       of a buffer
```


4. conversion
   - `number-to-string`
   - `string-to-number`
   - `int-to-string`

5. raise errors: `(error "this is not expected to run.")`

6. save-excursion
save last operating point  
```
(defun neuron--setup-overlays ()
  "Setup title overlays on zettel links."
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (re-search-forward neuron-link-regex nil t)
      (let ((ov (make-overlay (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0) nil t nil)))
        (message (match-string 1))))))
```
