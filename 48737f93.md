# Rust: smart pointers

- has some metadata apart from just holding references (which normal pointers do)
- in contrast to normal pointers, they hold the data they point to

- Two important traits when it comes to smart pointers are **Deref** and **Drop**. `Deref` allows the struct to be dereferenced, this is used to expose the underlying data (redirection).
- `Drop`: when value goes out of scope, the heap data the smart pointer points to is cleaned as well.

## Box<T>

```rust

fn box_ex() {
    let b = Box::new(5);
    println!("b is {}, at {:p}", b, b);
}

fn cons_list() {
    enum List<T> {
        Cons(T, Box<List<T>>),
        Nil,
    }

    use List::{Cons, Nil};

    let lis: List<i32> = Cons(1, Box::new(Cons(2, Box::new(Cons(3, Box::new(Nil))))));
}

```

- `*box_value` => `*(box_val.deref())`


## Deref Coercion
-  apply Deref as man times as needed to match the function signature. This is resolved at compile time => no runtime costs.

## Drop trait
- `drop` function is a kind of destructor. 
- to explicitly drop, use `std::mem::drop` 

## Rc<T>
- when value has multiple owners (like a graph nodes with multiple values)
- this is not thread-safe i.e. it's only for single threaded scenarios
- cannot share mutable references lest you break the rule of not having immutability and mutability at same time (or multiple mutables at the same time).

```rust

fn rc_smartp() {
    enum List<T> {
        Cons(T, Rc<List<T>>),
        Nil,
    }

    use List::{Cons, Nil};

    let a = Rc::new(Cons(1, Rc::new(Cons(2, Rc::new(Nil)))));
    {
        let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
        let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
        println!("RC of a {}", Rc::strong_count(&a)); //prints 3
    }
    println!("RC of a {}", Rc::strong_count(&a)); //prints 1
}

```

## RefCell<T>
- interior mutability pattern: mutate data even if immutable references exist. The pattern uses unsafe rust. Note that borrowing rules still have to followed at run time (rather than the usual compile time checking). This is useful when you've more information about the code than the compiler and can guarantee that the borrow rules are followed.
- **borrowing rules**: 
  - references must always be valid (no dangling pointers)
  - either 1 mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
  
- can mutate the value inside `RefCell<T>` at runtime even if `RefCell<T>` is immutable.
- has the `borrow_mut` and `borrow` method. These return `RefMut<T>` and `Ref<T>` values respectively. Both implement `Deref`
- `RefCell` keeps track of active `RefMut` and `Ref` - the borrowing rules must be enforced at runtime.
- this is used in context when you need to modify the value but only immutable is allowed (like mocking)


## RefCell<T> + Rc<T> : having multiple owners of mutable data
- have `Rc<T>` hold `RefCell<T>` 
- There are other standard library types which provide interior mutability pattern - `Cell` and `Mutex` 

## Reference cycles
- lead to memory leaks
- can be avoided using `Weak<T>` instead of `Rc<T>` 
- `Rc::downgrade`: returns weak reference of a reference
- `Rc::upgrade` : returns optional weak reference

```rust

fn refcycle() {
    #[derive(Debug)]
    enum List {
        Cons(i32, RefCell<Rc<List>>),
        Nil,
    }

    use List::{Cons, Nil};

    impl List {
        fn tail(&self) -> Option<&RefCell<Rc<List>>> {
            match self {
                Cons(_, tail) => Some(tail),
                Nil => None,
            }
        }
    }

    let a = Rc::new(Cons(1, RefCell::new(Rc::new(Nil))));
    let b = Rc::new(Cons(2, RefCell::new(Rc::clone(&a))));

    if let Some(link) = a.tail() {
        *link.borrow_mut() = Rc::clone(&b);
    }

    println!("{:?}", a.tail()); // goes off to infinity
}
```
