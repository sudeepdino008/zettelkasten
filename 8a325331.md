# Soft Zone

What's brilliant about Kohli, Ronaldo or Messi is that when abused or sledged, they come back stronger and make you pay for it. It's a fuel for them, and that's how they've trained themselves to be. Soft zone is about using the obstacles and converting it into something positive for you.  
A weakness in you can be your strength depending on the way you choose to respond to it. For example, people high in status-seeking can regard this as their weakness ("oh, I'm low on genuineness and humility. I'm probably vain" etc.) or they can use this spotlight as a motivation and use it enhance their performance.
