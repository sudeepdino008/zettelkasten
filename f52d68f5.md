## Basics

- Live below your means
- don't optimize for money, optimize for the freedom/experiences the money can buy you.
- Make sure you and your partner have similar financial values.

### Emergency Savings Fund
- As the name suggests, this is for emergency situations like if home needs repair or you've to get off work (unemployment or illness)
- You might wanna cover yourself for about 4 months.
- It should include some important expenses:
1. Rent and maintainence. (about 15-17k)
2. Food (about 3k)
3. Insurance (if you're unemployed, are you still on the ex-employer's health plan? Should you buy a new one?)
4. Debt repayment (30k currently)
5. Transportation (3k)
6. Other personal expenses: household supplies, clothes etc. (4k)
7. Parents (20k)

- The total of this comes around 75k.
- For 4-6 months, this comes about **4Lakhs**.
- The next question is where to keep this money. It can either go in savings account or in some money market account. If going for the later, the investment mode should be safe/stable like FD, it should also be possible to take out the money quickly (2-3 days is fine)


### Interest

#### Compound Interest: Rule of 72
If x% compounding annually, how long does it take to double your money? approx. = 72/x
For interests rate till about 20%, this works pretty well.


#### Why interest rates go up and down
Federal reserve (the Central Bank) tries to keep the prices stable by changing the interest rates of loans on various commodities .  
It ups the interest rate when inflation gets too high. This discourages people and companies to take loans, thereby reducing how much people spend.  
In a similar way, Fed might reduce the interest rate when economy isn't growing or unemployment rate is high. This makes taking out loans and spending easier, thereby creating more jobs.

* Car loans: makes sense to buy them when the interest rates are lower.
* Return on savings: This usually doesn't fluctuate a lot to make a difference.

#### Annual Percentage Rate

Credit cards and bank accounts might mention that the APR is 22.9% (0.062474% daily periodic rate). The thing in bracket suggests that it's compounded daily.

Effective APR = 1-(1.00062474)**365 = 0.257

Hence the effect APR is 25.7%

I've seen SBI etc. calculate their interests quaterly, while Citi bank does a daily compounding (which might seem a lot, but the effective APR turns out be very close to SBIs')
