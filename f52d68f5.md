A primer on [[[9fee62f2]]]


### explore further

- have some money in the bank to capitalise when the market is down.
- EPFs and the returns they give
EPFs (Employeed Provident Fund): tax free employee/employer contribution + 8.5% interest (again tax free)



##### Things to think about

- what will be the investment strategy for long term capital building?  
Index funds? mutual funds? mix? PPFs?
- what's my financial goal? long term and short term
- invest in US stocks (like NASDAQ) since they've performed better than indian stocks in last few years. [But since india is a growing economy, is it better to invest here too?]
