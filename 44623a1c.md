# [The New Adventures of Socrates: an extravagance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37505891-the-new-adventures-of-socrates)

I've always been reluctant to foray into Socrates and Plato because I thought they were outdated or just crazy men talking about utopian societies. But nearly every idea that Manny picked here was extremely relevant. I'm convinced enough to give Socrates and Plato a shot.  

It's a brilliant idea to introduce philosophy in the form of parody. Wish Manny released more such books. Am I greedy or what?  

EDIT: Just realised that **Godel, Escher, Bach** followed a similar format of parody/dialogue followed by a formal discussion of the topic at hand. Is there a word for such a format of interweaving dialgoues?
