# Polarization	


- Social media's recommendation engine is geared towards getting more engagement. 	
- The algorithm has been designed or evolved to a point where it exploits confirmation biases - the tendency to search/interpret/focus on information that confirms one's own beliefs.	
- You are shown videos which have worked on you before. Or news feed which are aligned with your beliefs.	
- This leads to Polarization, which has been on a massive rise recently - people are not friends with people having opposing views.
