# mental stamina

If you reach exhaustion rather easily, without feeling like you have accomplished much, it might help to think about mental hygiene and stamina to keep going. 
- `Declutter`:  
The first question to ask is if you are exhausted from proper mental exhaustion (applying your mind where you actually want) or some of the energy sinks, like adding to-read books on Goodreads or going through your shopping cart.  
Decluttering is easily one of the simplest things you can change in your environment - disable notifications; clean your workspace.
- `One thing at a time`:  
A related strategy to declutter is to stop treating yourself like a multitasking computer, and just execute on one thing at a time. This applies not only to the timeframe of a moment, but stretched to a few hours or a day. Sometimes, doing less allows you to do more. Be deliberate about how you spend your time, and doing just that one thing allows you to be deliberate.
- `Just sit`:  
Our default when faced with uncomfortable situations (like facing a tiger) is flight. It might have made sense in the ancestral environment, but when the looming problem is a calculus problem, it doesn't serve anyone well. I get nervous stomach when I'd really rather be someplace else. Rather than fleeing, just get away from the workstation, and sit. Take a few breathes or meditate for a few minutes. Soak in the discomfort, and very soon you'll be back to tackle it.  
One of the worst things you can do here is to distract yourself with your phone or a video. It's fine to do these when the break was planned and deliberate. But watching a youtube video is one of the worst things you can do when taking a break because you feel overwhelmed.

Use the pomodoro for God's sake! It's very easy to sift shift into a state of fuzziness if you sit for hours on end because you vaguely feel that you must do so (or because you're unaware of the option). It's much easier to decide to focus for next 30 minutes, than rely on some extremely transient affirmation before you sit to focus.
- `Build`: With the above strategies, you should've eliminated a lot of distraction, and can sit for x amount of time (if not, you probably need to try some other methods). From this point, look to extend your focus time by a tiny bit.

- `Self-care`:  
Needless to say, sleep, food, water, exercise and meditation are essentially to keep a fit body and mind.
- `When in doubt, shorten the time`:  
This is a counter-intuitive strategy, but it'll be interesting to see how it applies.  
When you don't feel like doing that project you've been working on (but absolutely need to work on), don't plow ahead with more will power. Instead, do less. Allocate lesser time to it, and more time on self-care. You can negotiate to get a little bit out by working less on it, while doing other things that might actually recharge you or find interesting at that point.

Adults often complain about not having time. I wonder to what extent snacking, a time sink often accompanied by dim awareness, is involved in it.
