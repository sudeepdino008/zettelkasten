# Cloud computing

on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources

## 5 essential characteristics
- on-demand self-service : no human interaction required
- broad network access: can be accessed via network via standard methods like mobile, tablets, laptops etc.
- resource pooling: multi-tenant model - resources are pooled and assigned/reassigned to users depending on demand
- rapid elasticity: resources are elastically provisioned and released
- measured service: pay for what you use


## Cloud deployment models
- public  
leverage cloud services over open internet on hardware owned by cloud provider, but its usage is shared by other companies
- private  
provisioned for exclusive use by single org. Can be run on premises or it could be owned, managed and operated by a service provider.
- hybrid  
mix of both public and private clouds.
