# Hot cold empathy Gap

It’s a cognitive bias which happens because we underestimate the influence of visceral emotions (anger, hunger, drug addition etc.) on their attitudes, behavior and preferences. One important aspect of this idea is that human understanding is “state-independent”. For example: when you are angry, it’s difficult to imagine what it’s like to be calm and vice versa.  
Hot-cold empathy gaps can be analyzed by their direction:

- *Hot to cold*  
People under visceral influences find it difficult to estimate how much their short term goals align with long term goals.  
- *Cold to hot*  
Difficulty in imagining oneself in a hot state. The motivational strength of visceral strength can be minimized. Unpreparedness (when visceral emotions actually arise) is another effect.
