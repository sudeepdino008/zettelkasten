# Avoid Competition

### To avoid competition, be authentic
People compete when they seek to be like everyone else.  
This is the best time to offer something no one else can.  
Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until
this is true.  
Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more
important than how you work.
### What are your core strengths? Are you the best at it? 
Work iteratively towards being the best at it.
