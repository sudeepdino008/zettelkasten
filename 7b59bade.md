# ego is the enemy



## TODO: previous chapters
## TODO: breakdown into zettels

## follow the canvas strategy
> Great men have almost always shown themselves as ready to obey as they afterwards proved able to command. - Lord Mahon

- In the initial stages of your journey, you've to just put your head down and work, with less attention on credit.
- Make the job of those above you easier by clearing out their paths, finding canvases for people to paint on.
- By solving other's problems, you'll learn a great deal by solving diverse problems, build countless relationships, and an enormous bank favors to call upon down the road.
- The opposite of this is to follow your glamorous path to glory--though it's hardly as effective. Obeisance is the way forward early on.

## Restrain yourself
- This is about not growing excited to the point of losing self control. Being calm, self-possessed, patient and polite.  
You simply cannot lose temper as a refuge from despair.
- When you want to do something big, and are starting out, you'll face seemingly undeserved treatment ranging from indifference to outright sabotage. Count on it.
- Those who've subdued their ego know that it doesn't degrade you when others treat you poorly.
- It's a timeless fact of life that the up-and-coming must ensure the abuses of the entrenched. 

## Get out of your own head - Quit the fantasy
- There are fictional characters like the protaganist in the Catcher in the Rye or The underground man. These are cautionary tales of what happens when you live too much inside your head.  
The real world is too much for them due to their obsession and insecurity, and they consequently lose touch with reality.
- Similary, 2400 years ago, Plato talked about such type of people who are guilty of "feasting on their own thoughts." Real people living in passionate fictions rather than actual reality.  
The tendency is to imagine their successes and then building/imagining things they would do once that certain thing is achieved. This vision of perfection satisfies them, the actual pursuit is not needed, making them lazier.
- Adolescence is marked by a phenomenon known as "imaginary audience", wherein the teen thinks that ze's every action, flair and results are being scrutinized by everyone else. As adults, this tones down a bit, but we are still susceptible. Even a harmless leisure walk down the streets can turn into a performance, with the crowd parting ways, ego all puffed up.
- Our imagination--is our asset--but when it runs wild, we can lose touch of reality, causing us to make poor decisions. 
- The reinforcement of fantasies distract us even more. It's a negative spiral, sucking your focus out.  
> How can we be creative within the realm of practicality?
- Living clearly and presently takes courage. Living in the haze of abstract, is easy but also endless misery. It's an antithesis to flow and awareness. 
- There's no one to perform for. Just work to be done, and lessons to be learned.



## Review
It's only a mildly exciting read; Nothing spectacular. But it is essential; Soul's bread and butter. The basics of right being.
