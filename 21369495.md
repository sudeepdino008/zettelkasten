# A Philosophy of Software Design

## complexity

The book is about how to design software systems to minimize their complexity. Complexity has various kinds - 
- Change Amplification: the same change needs to be done in tons of different places, rather than at a single place
- Cognitive load: developer needs to be aware of and handle more things e.g. C memory allocation requires you to free a malloc'ed memory.
- unknown unknowns: worst culprits. It's what you don't know about the system. The bugs that arises in production.

Complexity arise due to:
- dependency: knowing the system requires you to know other parts of it. You can't study parts of system in isolation. This leads to change amplification and cognitive load. e.g. in network protocols, the server and client must maintain the same format at all times.
- obscurity: important information is not obvious or available. e.g. using variable called `time` - wherein you have no indication about what it is used for. It's lack of comments or maybe a obscure hack. It leads to unknown unknowns as well as cognitive load

## mindset

> Working code is not enough.

tactical mindet: ship working code as fast as possible; design improvements can be made later; startups are particularly susceptible to this.
strategic mindset: make cleaner designs right now. Also, improve the design incrementally while refactoring. It might slow down your development time by 10-20%, but pays off in the long run.

The cost of working with spagetti code is immense, and usually the word gets around and you won't be able to hire strong engineers. Complexity increases incrementally - it might be tempting to think that it's okay to just get working code for the current feature as it needs to go out quickly. But if everyone thinks the same way, the complexity increases fast, and then it's even more difficult to get out of the hole. It's best to make strategic investments in design as you're working through the code.
