# social perfectionism


- Social perfectionism - People expect nothing less than perfection out of me. Success means working harder to please others. It's not about what you expect from yourself.
- Is this about perceived failure to fulfil roles? Men earlier had to be bread-winners, father, protector. Now they have to be metrosexual too. Stay on top all the time. Stay on top of the social hierarchy. [Recount all the instances where you had imagine people below you and people above you. When you used the career or health ladder to assign worth. ] 
- Hypothesis is that social perfectionists are more sensitive to signals of failures in the environment. 
- Theory of Roy Baumesiter - Escape from the self: The process starts with some failing where the self fell severely short of expectations and standards. It's not enough to feel like a failure, the self must also lose faith in its capacity to change.

<95beceec?cf> is another idea related to ambition and social perfectionism.
