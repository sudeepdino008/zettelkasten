# files


- loop through all files in a directory (recursively): `find ./`
- Check if file ends with gz:
```bash
if [[ $file_name == *.gz ]]; then
    echo "matched"
    gunzip $file_name
done
```


## fill file with dummy data 

Might need this for testing purposes (how fast various commands are)
use `seq` command
```bash
seq 100 > sample.txt
```
