## How to Ask More Questions

- **Uncertainty is fine**. It's a breeding ground for questions. Ask them explore them. When you feel butterflies in your stomach, or more explicity notice an unknown arena, that means you are in a great place to ask questions.
- Be more deliberate with questioning. For example: What if i can ask 5 questions everyday - one set for relationships, one for career, one for curiosity of the world?
