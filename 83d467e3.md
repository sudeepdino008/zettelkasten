### Returns 
what's the expected rate of return

### Risk
- difference between expected and actual rate of return
- if returns of investment are unchanged over time, there is no risk. But there are only few options with no risk (FD or PPFs)
- Some risk are managed strategically - Diversification
- Some risk are managed tactically - Asset allocation.

Types of risk:
1. Default (or credit) risk  
Borrowers won't be able to honor the commitment to pay the interest/principal as scheduled.

2. Liquidity risk  
Liquidity or marketability is the ease with which an investment can be bought or sold in the market.  
Liquidity risk implies resistance to this ease: Investors will not be able to sell their investment as required; Or sell the investment below intrinsic value; or high transaction cost; or lock-in periods.  
You also have to consider if the investment is long-term for you, in which case you won't want to liquidate the assets.

3. Business risk  
Risk inherent to the operations of the company.

4. Exchange rate risk  
Due to changes in exchange rate of domestic and foreign currency.

5. Market risk
Loss in investment due to adverse movement in price of the asset in the market.
FDs have a predetermined amount on maturity and therefore do not carry market risk.


#### Possible combinations
These are (high risk, high returns) or (low risk, low returns). Other combinations are not possible.

### Liquidity
How fast can you liquidate assets

### Volatility
Extent to which the expected returns can fluctuate. For example: stocks are volatile, FDs are not.

### Tax treatment
FD is subject to tax; PPF is not

### Compounding 
How many years of compounding effect does the investment option offer?
FDs typically offer an interest rate of around 5%, but if inflation rate is more than 6%, it leads to capital depreciation. Hence a 5% FD with 6% inflation is not a good long term investment strategy.
