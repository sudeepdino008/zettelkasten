# Good writers are good readers

- Good writers are good readers - spotting, savoring and reverse engineering examples of good prose.
- Perfecting the craft is a lifelong game, and mistakes are a part of that game. Though the quest for improvement can be informed by lessons and honed by practice, it must first be kindled by a delight in the best works of the master and a desire to approach their excellence.
- Good writing starts strong, not with a cliche or banality.

- Good writing is understood with the mind's eye.
> A big slice of watermelon that she appears to be struggling to have intersect with the small o of her mouth.
The little girl is endearing not because the author stoops to tell she's cute or adorable, but because we can see the child-like mannerisms for ourseves.
- Do not use big words when a simple one will do - is bad advice. Sure, there's a lot of prose that stinks with obscure, abrupt words. But a good writer can enliven ze prose with the right word (reading `titillating` for example evokes what it means, and it's no coincidence that `haunting` means what it means).  
Writers shouldn't shy away from a word if it's dead-on meaning, evocative in sound, and not so obscure that the reader will never see it again.
- Insistence of concrete imagery over familiar verbiage and abstract summary.  
Orwell had warned against using the English language to dehumanize. Millions of farmers and their families forced to abandon their ancestral lands being termed as "transfer of population".  
This has serious implications specially in fields like social sciences, where real people can be abstracted to statistics.
- Finish Strong.
