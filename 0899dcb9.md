## fundamental skillsets

- finding and choosing a long-term path
- write/think/speak ideas clearly
- awareness and concentration
- stay healthy: best exercise is what you can do daily.
- engineering and building: have confidence in building things
- learn the basic principles of design
- communication, negotiation and persuasion
- asking questions
- being happy
- reading at the right pace, with comprehension
- having an extremely lightweight sense of self

## blog ideas
- Papers that had massive impact on me 
  1. The half a second delay
  2. the best cure to addiction is being aware of it.


## Engineering and CS

- learn how an AC works
- assemble a computer
- understand pandas dataframe ([link](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_pandas/python_pandas_introduction_to_data_structures.htm))
- a d3 graph rendering of my zettelkasten. (preferably using reflux, such that no hot loading is required)  
`neuron query --graph` spits out the zettelkasten graph in json format, all the info you need.
- [how git works](https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/)

### functional programming
- blog about all the interesting ideas in functional data structures (and do it in haskell!)
- finish off the last chapter in SICP
- graph algorithms using streams/lazy evaluations/higher order functions etc.
- [reflex: functional reactive programming](https://reflex-frp.org/)

### open source
- get neuron-mode working for cli version 0.9.0
- move away from autolinks to the more recent `[[[...]]]` style folgezettel links.
- hack neuron to be able to use richer markdown formats.
- hack neuron to be able to use pandadoc filters to draw graphs 


### iOS and Android

#### App ideas
- An app to monitor the stock market. It should allow you to create custom triggers to events (certain changes in prices), and notify you when such an event occurs.
- App to help you maintain a time logger. It should be easy to add entries (along with tags). And should have insights from it. Once this is done, create a web app using elm.
- A work tracker app with pomodoro as its base.

#### learning

- Understand through and through how core data works.
- Coordinator pattern
- better swift: read a networking library (Example: Moya, a lightweight network layer on top of Alamofire, which is an abstraction on top of CoreNetwork )
- value and reference types implementation in swift
- Objc_msgSend impl
- Core data structure and concurrency
- Dispatch Queue APIs and concepts
- Keypaths in swift


## Abstract/not so well defined

- learn reverse engineering on iOS
- learn and apply the principles of classic prose in journalling/blogging.
- web apps using flutter/elm/haskell

## Life skills

- learn to ride a bike
- learn to drive a car
- learn shorthand writing



## Understanding

- guilt as motivation
- gamification of life - how to do it (and do it right)
- Flow (how to)
- functional data structure concepts
- understanding overwhelmness.
- how startup finance works
- personal finance - stock markets, mututal/index funds and so on. [Khan academy course, Mohit's presentation]
- english grammar
- research on neural resonance (related to empathy) and communication
- Labelling emotions moves the activity from the amygdala (the part causing fear) to the areas that govern rational thinking - MAtthew Lieberman - "Putting feelings into Words: Affect Labeling disrupts Amygdala activity in response to affective stimuli"
