# Haskell: Higher Order Functions

- Every function in haskell officialy takes only a single parameter.
- Currying or partial application: when a function is called with too few parameters. This is the reason why we declare the type of a `max` function as `Ord a => a -> a -> a` and not as `Ord a => (a, a) -> a`
- Generally, if you have a function like `foo a = bar b a`, you can rewrite it as `foo = bar b`

## zipping
```haskell
zip [1,2,3] [4,5,6]
[(1,4), (2,5), (3,6)]
```

## lambdas: anonymouse functions ofcourse
Written with a `\`

```haskell
-- BMI again

> Main.zipWith (\w h -> w / (h*h))  [1,3,10,100]  [2,4,10,1]
[0.25,0.1875,0.1,100.0]
```

It's sometimes neater to define functions using `\` notations, for example flip:

```haskell
flip' :: (a->b->c) -> b -> a -> c
flip' f x y = f y x

or using `\`
flip' f = \x y -> f y x
```
Flip is often used by applying a function f, to get a curried function, and then passing this function to a map or filter. The second representation is better aligned with this common use case of flip.

## reduce functions: left fold (`foldl`) and right fold (`foldr`)
```haskell
-- check if element y is present in list ys
elem' y ys = foldl (\acc x -> acc || x==y) False ys
```

Folds are useful when you want to traverse the list and then return something based on that.  
Note that right folds (start from some place and move left), will inevitably return some value; Left folds will go folding forever!

## scan
`scanl` and `scanr` are similar to their folds counterpart, but they return the intermediate results as well.

```haskell
sums = scanl (\acc x -> acc + x) 0 
sums [2,3,9,0]
[0,2,5,14,14]
```

Scans are used to monitor the progression of a function that can be implemented as a fold. For example: How many elements does it take for the sum of the roots of all natural numbers to exceed 1000?

## Function application using $

$ has a low precedence, which means it's right associative. So something like `sum (map sqrt [1..130])` can be written as `sum $ map sqrt [1..130]`  
Or `sqrt (3+4+5)` can be written as `sqrt $ 3 + 4 + 5`  
It basically gets the right-side expression to be evaluated, and then applied to the left operator.

## Function composition

`(f o g)(x) = f(g(x))` can be done in haskell using . operator  
`negate . (* 3)` function takes a number, multiplies by 3 and then negates it.


point free style
```haskell
fn x = ceiling ( negate ( tan ( cos ( max 50 x ))))
-- we can't get rid of x on both sides

-- using point free style
fn = ceiling . negate . tan . cos . max 50

```
