# Blockchain: Sidechains and cross-chain communication

- Problem: if you want to convert coin X to coin Y. This is easy if it's on the same blockchain (say ethereum uniswap). But for different chains, how can we do it trustlessly?

Atomic Cross-chain swaps
- atomic swaps: atomically perform transactions that swaps coins across the chains.

Sidechains

wrapped bitcoins:
- deposit bitcoins to a custodial address. A smart contract can then mint ERC-20 tokens on ethereum and you can go and unlock them. 
- cross chain transfers
