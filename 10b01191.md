# Constructivism in Computer Science Education

![Nuremberg funnel](static/nuremberg_funnel.png)

- constructivism is the idea in pedagogy that students construct knowledge rather than merely receive it.


## Motivation
- example with WYSIWYG word processors: here the lack of knowledge of underlying data structures in say microsoft word leads to incorrect operations. The underlying model is not clear at all.
- a viable mental model must be constructed so that novel situations can be handled.

## Discovery/Inquiry Learning is another paradigm
- similar to constructivism where student is expected to explore & inquire, discover knowledge by themselves when placed in appropriate context
- unfettered sicovery is probably not helpful. There should also be cumulative constructuvusm where the knowledge acquired during discovery phases is combined/organized.

## Constructivism in CS education
- misconceptions are a result of non-viable models. It's not a mistake but a consistent logical construction based on a non-standard theory.
- misconception must be accompanied by the model that caused it. Merely listing it is useless. Some even consider misconception as the prior knowledge from which new knowledge can be created!


there are two unique factors in regards to constructivism in CSE as compared to say Physics:
- no effective model of a computer (compared to say physics) : this poses a serious obstacle as imperfect models (misconceptions) might be the basis for prior knowledge.
- computer forms an accessible ontological reality (feedback is immediate)

### What do do??
- explicitly teach the model
- teach programs as mathematical objects that need not be executed on a computer.
- Don't start with abstractions like OOP. Abstractions are a result of cumulation of finer details.
- Author: Introductory CSE should be taight in functional or logic programming paradigm, as they can be explained in relatively high-level hardware-free terms.

## Minimalism
- used in design of manuals for software documentation.
- has similar approached to constructivism:
  - active learning to construct mental model
  - importance of pre-existing knowledge
  - errors & misconceptions as pedagogical devices rather than system of failure.
  
- minimalism works only for basic tasks needing step by step instructions though, as it doesn't advocate creation mental models.


## Don't run to the computer!
- mentals models first, programming exercises late.
- running programs as a way to supplement rather than supplant mental models.
- FYI, MIT teaches Scratch now.
- assessment: design written questions that elicit information about the student's mental model.

## Guide to educators
- articulate (to yourself) the cognitive change that you wish to tbring in students.
- what prior knowledge do yuo have which allowed you to construct the desired mental model. You must ensure that the students have the same prior knowledge.
- in a course if your're teaching a specific level of abstraction; you must explicity present a viable model of one level below.
- mistakes come from more-or-less consistent but non-viable mental model. Your task is to elicit and guide the model
- opportunities for individual and social interaction.
