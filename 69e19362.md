# seek opposing views


- With confirmation bias as a part of human brain, we must follow some heuristics to counter it.
- Deliberately seek evidences and facts which you don't agree with. Understand that POV.
- Social media is particularly notorious for recommending things you agree with: Don't click anything from youtube's recommendation system. Always search for the content you want to see.
