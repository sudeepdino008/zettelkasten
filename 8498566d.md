# Dunning-Kruger effect

- cognitive bias where people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability.
- Recognizing that you lack in ability can be emotionally difficult. It's easier to convince yourself that you have the ability. For example, it's easy to convince yourself that you understand some blog article or topic.

- The remedies against Dunning-Kruger effects are: 
  - to `estimate better(objectively)` by design tests to gauge your abilities.  
  For example, a <23bcd3fe?cf> helps you write down what you find interesting, and along the way nail your understanding.
  - teach someone else (verbal/blogging etc.)
