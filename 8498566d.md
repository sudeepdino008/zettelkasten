# Dunning-Kruger effect


- coginitive bias where people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability.
- Recognising that you lack in ability can be emotionally difficult. It's easier to convince yourself that you have the ability. For example, it's easy to convince yourself that you understand some text. But only after you take some tests can you really gauge your level.

- The remedies against Dunning-Kruger effects are to estimate better by design tests to gauge your abilities OR teach someone else (verbal/blogging etc.)
