# Interest Rates

#### Compound Interest: Rule of 72
If x% compounding annually, how long does it take to double your money? approx. = 72/x
For interests rate till about 20%, this works pretty well.


#### Why interest rates go up and down
Federal reserve (the Central Bank) tries to keep the prices stable by changing the interest rates of loans on various commodities .  
It ups the interest rate when inflation gets too high. This discourages people and companies to take loans, thereby reducing how much people spend.  
In a similar way, Fed might reduce the interest rate when economy isn't growing or unemployment rate is high. This makes taking out loans and spending easier, thereby creating more jobs.

* Car loans: makes sense to buy them when the interest rates are lower.
* Return on savings: This usually doesn't fluctuate a lot to make a difference.

#### Annual Percentage Rate

Credit cards and bank accounts might mention that the APR is 22.9% (0.062474% daily periodic rate). The thing in bracket suggests that it's compounded daily.

Effective APR = 1-(1.00062474)**365 = 0.257

Hence the effect APR is 25.7%

I've seen SBI etc. calculate their interests quaterly, while Citi bank does a daily compounding (which might seem a lot, but the effective APR turns out be very close to SBIs')
