# Heroku


## deploy
slug: an executable ourput of your source code, dependencies, language runtime compiled and ready to be executed. It can either be a predefined framework (like django, such that heroku already knows how to build it) OR you specify the processes in the Procfile.

The slug along with the config variables (known as **config vars** in heroku) define a release. Releases are append only log of release (slug + config vars) and you can roll back across releases etc.

**Buildpacks** are set of scripts which convert the deployed code into a slug. Buildpacks are available for different programming languages.


## runtime
The release is deployed on a dyno - isolated, virtualized unix containers. Across dynos, the filesystem is ephemeral, so for things like queue or database, you've to use add-ons.

logplex - collates the logs from all the dynos: `heroku logs` 

Routing: The dynos that run the process `web` receive HTTP traffic and heroku routes the requests between several available dynos.

## Architecture

### process model
Unix process model is a simple, powerful abstraction for running server side programs. You can run a program on the terminal and it launches a process. This is fine for local development, but for server side deployment, your process needs to be **managed** - it should start up when your OS starts up and if it crashes, it should be restarted. `launchd` in mac and `systemd` in linux are examples of process managers. In heroku, dyno manager works an analogous role.  
An application can have multiple entry points into the applications called **process type**. For example, a django application can have a web process type and a worker process type (based on say celery). A process type is essentially a prototype from which (possibly) multiple instances of dynos is instantiated.

## Other terminology
- preboot: if preboot is enabled on every release, Heroku ensures that the new release is deployed and receiving web traffic before the old ones are terminated.
- release phase: an optional phase that happens just before a new release is deployed. It's useful if some commands must be run before the deployment like database migrations.
