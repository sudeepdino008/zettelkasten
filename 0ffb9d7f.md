# Stoicism

> Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, 
> Courage to change the things I can, 
> and Wisdom to know the difference.

> My idea of the modern Stoic sage is someone who transforms
> fear into prudence,
> pain into information,
> mistakes into initiation,
> and desire into undertaking.  
> -- Nassim Taleb
