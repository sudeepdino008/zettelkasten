# You don't know what you're fighting for


### You don't know what you're fighting for (exactly), you can only know the general direction.

- replacing feeling guilty about doing nothing (listless guilt), to feeling guilty about not doing something in particular - this is easier to address.
- Your values/preferences are a result of millions of years of complex evolution and are influenced in myriad ways by thousand years of culture. It's almost naive to expect them to be simple. They are a multitude of desires smashed together by Time.  
It's therefore skeptical to claim when someone says that they know what they want through and through.  
It's not that your values are inherently unknowable, if you live long enough, you can probably map out the territory. But we don't know them yet.
- But that doesn't mean we are throwing darts in the dark. We have a hell lot of evidence for our values (preferring pleasure over pain, for example). 
- You don't know exactly what you're fighting for, but the world's is in bad enough shape that you don't need to.
- To overcome listless guilt, know what you are fighting for, but the caution is that you probably might not know exactly what that means. You will know what direction the arrow is pointing towards though.
