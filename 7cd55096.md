# Django: Model Layer

- abstraction layer for structuring/manipulating data in your application
- `Model.objects`: `.objects` is the manager which gives access to underlying db and perform table wide operations. Model instances also provide a way to do row operations - which are provided as instance methods. 
- foreign keys: many to one, one to one, many to many
- Custom field types
- `Meta` : you can gice your model metadata, like default ordering or table name or uniquing on several fields etc.
- model inheritance: you need to decide if the super class is going to be a separate table or just holder of common information. Abstract base classes OR multi-table inheritance.  
There's also the Proxy model when just the meta information has to be changed in subclass.

## queries
- create objects; save objects, with the ability to save `ForeignKey` and `ManyTOManyField` fields.
- retrieving objects: `all`; for specific objects, you use `QuerySets` 

### Retrieving objects

**query set**
- query sets are lazily evaluated. You can chain a bunch of `filter` and `exclude` , and when you force the fetch, only one db query will go. 
- There are cases like testing QuerySet in a boolean context or len() where QuerySet might be immediately executed.
- get a single entry: `get`
- slicing a query set creates another query set (translated internall to OFFSET and LIMIT SQL keywords). The exception is when using steps in slicing (due to ambiguous nature of such a construction)
- QuerySet caching: in a newly created QuerySet, the cache is empty. It's populated first time it's evaluated and subsequent queries use the cache.
- QuerySet is not cached when you've limited the queryset (using slicing or indexing)



**field lookups**
- this deals with creating the `WHERE` clause of the SQL query
- the arguments are of type `fieldname__lookuptype=value` e.g. `Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__lte='2006-01-01')`  
- lookups can also span relationships, using `SQL JOIN` underneath. e.g. `Blog.objects.filter(entry__headline__contains='Lennon')`  

**F() expressions**
- `django.db.models.expressions` and `django.db.models.aggregates`
- F() object represents the value of a model field, transformed value of a model field or annotated column.
- we can use F() object in filtering or updates, and the corresponding SQL statement will be generated.
- essentially, it allows database to do the work, rather than python. In some cases it can reduce number of db queries too.
- it can also avoid race conditions.
```python
Entry.objects.filter(number_of_comments__gt=F('number_of_pingbacks')
```

**expressions can reference transforms**
```python
## find earliest year an entry was published
Entry.objects.aggregate(first_published_year=Min('pub_date__year'))
```

**pk lookup shortcut**
```python
Blog.objects.filter(pk=4)
Blog.objects.filter(pk__in=[1,4,6])
```

### Querying JSONField

### Q objects
- for joining filters using &, | or ~ : we can use Q() expressions:
```python
    Poll.objects.get(
    Q(question__startswith='Who'),
    Q(pub_date=date(2005, 5, 2)) | Q(pub_date=date(2005, 5, 6))
)

## translates to: SELECT * from polls WHERE question LIKE 'Who%'
    AND (pub_date = '2005-05-02' OR pub_date = '2005-05-06')
```
- you can inspect a Q object by using `repr(q_object)` etc.


### comparing and deleting
- comparing objects checks their primary key

### related objects
- when you have relationships in the model (ManyToManyField etc.), instances of that model have a convenient API to access related objects.
- behing the scenes this is implemented by python descriptors.

### falling back on raw SQL
- django is just provides an interface on top of the DB, if the needed SQL commands get too complicated, it's possible to just directly access the SQL interface


### Query expressions
- describe a value or a computation that can be used as part of an update, create, filter, order by, annotation or aggregate. e.g.: `F()`, `Func()` , `Aggregate()`  
- Query Expression API: set of methods that classes define to be usable in query expressions to translate themselves into SQL expressions.
