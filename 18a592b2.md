# iOS Architecture

- [mobius.swift](https://github.com/spotify/Mobius.swift)



## View Controllers
- two types - content VC and container VC.
- View controller is an intermediary between model and the view. Allowing both to be separated.
- A content VC has to lay out a bunch of views, while split view controller has to lay out child view controllers.
- Always maintain a clean separation of responsibilities between the VC and data objects--The logic for ensuring the integrity of your data structures belongs to the data object themselves.
- VCs also provide ways to handle user interaction.
- It also does resource management--freeing up view-related resources which are no longer needed. You can use the iOS's memory warning API to free up any custom data structures in view controllers (like cached data for table view).
