# Android App Architecture

## Building a foundation

### Model View Controller
In MVC, the entry point of the app is through the controller, the role of controller can be assigned to activity.   
Problem：The activity might contain some view references, handle displaying and hiding views, dynamically load layouts; In short, view logic. However this means that activity is serving both as controller *and* the view in this pattern. This causes Activity to bloat up significantly, and beats the purpose of MVC.

MVC makes unit testing the controller hard - The controller is Activity, which is part of the Android ecosystem. It has a lifecycle and is  depended on other Android components. You cannot use JUnit for it, and need to use something like Roboelectric, which runs slower than JUnit tests. ([[[8aa25221]]])  
Only the model can be unit tested in MVC.




### Android Architecture Components 
For many years, Android developers have had to handle database mappings, lifecycle management issues, asynchronous operations and other tricky challenges that were prone to errors and resulted in boilerplate code. In November 2017, Google introduced the Android Architecture Components, a collection of libraries to help with some of these architecture-related pain points.

**room**: provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, allowing to map objects to raw database content.  
**lifecycle**: the set of classes offer lifecycle management, allowing your components to adjust according to the lifecycle state of Android.  
**viewmodel**: Owns view data in a lifecycle conscious way; Allowing data ownership to be moved out of UI controllers. [link](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)  
The problem with letting the Activity handle the data is that when it gets destroyed (say when rotating the screen), the data it held is also lost. ViewModel offers  a robust way for the data to handle configuration changes.  
**livedata**: allows android UI views to observe model changes and react accordingly. Lifecycle aware. Similar to RxJava.  
Can be paired with room to update UI when the data in database changes.  
**paging**: allows you to load and display small chunks of data at a time. Loading partial data on demand reduces potential db or network overloads.
**Navigation**: specify navigation between different views.
**data binding**: allows you to bind UI elements to data sources in xml files (rather than in code)

## Fundamental UΙ architectures

### Model  View Presenter  (MVP)
The Activity is the view, which is also the entry point for the app. The Presenter is involved with populating the UI with data and other presentation logic. The view informs the presenter about any UI actions. The Model and presenter do not have any android-specific classes (like Activity or Intent), allowing them to be unit-testable.  
How is that possible? Presenter must have reference to activity or fragment to be able to update UI. This is done via using interface, allowing the two components to be separate and unit testable. 


### Model View ViewModel (MVVM)
- The ViewModel shouldn't contain any references to Views. 
- The ViewModel provides information to views via events (observables). This allows a one-to-many relationships where the views can request information from any ViewModel it needs.
- Owns view data in a lifecycle conscious way; Allowing data ownership to be moved out of UI controllers. [link](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)  
The problem with letting the Activity handle the data is that when it gets destroyed (say when rotating the screen), the data it held is also lost. ViewModel offers  a robust way for the data to handle configuration changes.  
- **View**: It's main role is to observe one or more ViewModels to power and update the necessary UI. Views also provide to ViewModels about user actions. Views can have reference to one of more viewmodels, but viewmodels never have reference to Views.
