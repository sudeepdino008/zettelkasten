# Android App Architecture

## Building a foundation

### Model View Controller
In MVC, the entry point of the app is through the controller, the role of controller can be assigned to activity.   
Problem：The activity might contain some view references, handle displaying and hiding views, dynamically load layouts. However this means that activity is serving both as controller *and* the view in this pattern. This beats the purpose of MVC.
