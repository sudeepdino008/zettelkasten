# Cryptocurrency: Key Features

## Decentralised
- no single party can close it (you'll need to capture 51% of the network to claim it).
- [[[a715685d]]] is decentralised/distributed and does not rely on a single party.

## new currencies
- the system defines how new currencies are created. It establishes rules for when these currencies are generated (capping/throttling/distribution) and who owns these new minted currencies.
- ?? what's the role of inflation in cryptocurrency? How do different types of cappings behave? Does it make a differece when it comes to evaluating the asset

## currency ownership
- the system can decide who is the owner of the cryptocurrency. As mentioned above, this can be done in a distributed manner using cryptography.
- the system provides a secure way of changing the ownership of the currency (transactions). It should be bullet-proof against problems like "double spend"

## state overview
- the system maintains the overview of the currencies and its ownership.
- the ledger is usually public. It can be private but that often means giving up decentralised control, which is the point of cryptocurrency.
