# Cryptocurrency: Key Features

## Decentralised
- no single party can close it (you'll need to capture 51% of the network to claim it).
- [[[a715685d]]] is decentralised/distributed and does not rely on a single party.

## new currencies
- the system defines how new currencies are created. It establishes rules for when these currencies are generated (capping/throttling/distribution) and who owns these new minted currencies.
- ?? what's the role of inflation in cryptocurrency? How do different types of cappings behave? Does it make a differece when it comes to evaluating the asset

## currency ownership / identity
- the system can decide who is the owner of the cryptocurrency. As mentioned above, this can be done in a distributed manner using cryptography.
- the system provides a secure way of changing the ownership of the currency (transactions). It should be bullet-proof against problems like "double spend"
- public key cryptography underlies the solution to identity or currency ownership problem in cryptocurrency. See [[[de7b6dbb]]]
- identity has another aspect in cryptos, in regards to Sybil Attacks (which are useless in cryptos because of the way consensus works - [[[a715685d]]], for example PoW is based on hash power, so creating multiple identities is futile.)

## state overview
- the system maintains the overview of the currencies and its ownership.
- the ledger is usually public. It can be private but that often means giving up decentralised control, which is the point of cryptocurrency.


### other features

## anonymity
[web3 view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okYBL9Ce7eA&list=PLxVihxZC42nF_MCN9PTvZMIifRjx9cZ2J&index=13): also mentions a lot of papers around this
- is bitcoin anonymous? - your name is not used, but a pseudonym is used (a pseudo-identity)
- technical definition of anonymity:
  - a pseudononymous system (which bitcoind provides)
  - unlinkability: individual but distinct interactions shouldn't be traceable to a single identity - bitcoin doesn't provide unlinkability
  
- make it computationally infeasible for anyone to track the participants in a transaction.
- is pseudononymity enough? - perhaps, but not if your goal is privacy! Blockchain is public - and if your address can be linked to your identity, you can easily be de-anonymized. Bitcoin is pseudononymous, NOT anonymous.

- in an ideal world, unlinkability means:
  - hard to link different addresses of the same user
  - hard to link different transactions of the same user
  - hard to link sender of the payment to the recipient.
  
- de-anonymization via side-channels. E.g.: paying with bitcoin at a coffee shop exposes your physical body to barista. OR analysis of usage time. Posting address somewhere (which is needed to receive payments)

- the third concepts turns out to be difficult, but we can use anonymity sets - hide the transaction in a bunch of other transactions. So when A sends some crypto to B, the transaction is hidden in all other transactions happening at the same time. The attacker can't link the payment received by B as being sent by A.
  - the larger the number of possible transactions, the better able to hide you are ('Cicada strategy')

- Avoid Address Re-use!!!

- [research papers on anonymity in bitcoin](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=anonymity+in+bitcoin&btnG=)

- network level anonymity: most often the node which tells you about a transaction is the source node itself
  - use tor: pretty slow for bitcoin purposes
  - dandelion protocol: some relaying node further down the line "gossips" about the message. Till then, the message is sent selectively (one hop, one server)
  
- dedicated mixing services - creates a better anonymity set
  - the transactions in the anonymity set should be equal (otherwise it's trivial to link sender and receiver)

- CoinJoin: "single-transaction mixing"
  - find peers who want to mix
  - exchange input/output addresses
  - construct transaction
  - send the transaction around. Each peer signs after verifying that their output is present
  - broadcast the transaction.

- privacy focused altcoins: zcash- zk-SNARKS (zero-knowledge succint non-interactive argument of knowledge proofs); anonymity by choice; Monero - ring signatures, RingCT, steath addresses; BEAM - mimblewimble protocol

- other privacy enhancements:
  - wasabi wallet: built-in coinjoin with every bitcoin transaction
  - AZTEC: privacy engine for ethereum to obscure input and output addresses
