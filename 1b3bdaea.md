# The Modern Mind

## skimming

### Intro

- It's not a book about science, but it plays a major role in it, since in the 20th century, we had a flood of discoveries which changes our understanding of the fundamentals of nature - gene, quantum, electron, unconscious. It wasn't only that  science was bringing close together many fields like geology, anthropology, mathematics, computer science, physics and others; but that its effects were spilling over in other areas of life - technology and even art (for example, cubism and existentialism seem to be a response to the discoveries of science).  
- Along with this, science has begun to reach a new stage in its evolution, where it has already started to infuse with philosophy and answer the most fundamental questions of life. Arts and humanities have spoken with less and less power, as the authority has shifted away from them towards science.
- The book is trying to map out the ideas by which we live today. It's a history of intellectual ideas.

### Freud to Wittgenstein : The sense of a beginning

- **Sigmund Freud's Interpretation of Dreams**
- 
> Freud rightly considered The Interpretation of Dreams to be his most significant achievement. It is in this book that the four fundamental building blocks of Freud's theory about human nature first come together: the unconscious, repression, infantile sexuality (leading to the Oedipus complex), and the tripartite division of the mind into ego, the sense of self; superego, broadly speaking, the conscience; and id, the primal biological expression of the unconscious.
- talking cure; free association; "dreams as a royal road to unconscious"
- Vienna Psychoanalytic Society

- **Genes**
- 
>And so, before the fledgling century was six months old, it had produced Mendelism, underpinning Darwinism, and Freudianism, both systems that presented an understanding of man in a completely different way.

- **Electrons** 
- Cathode ray experiment by J.J. Thompson

- **quantum**
- 
> The essence of Planck's idea, mathematical only to begin with, was that electromagnetic radiation was not continuous, as people thought, but could only be emitted in packets of a definite size.

- Picasso; and Bertrand Russel's foundation of mathematics
- Conclusion:  
> The central points to grasp are, first, the extraordinary complementarity of many ideas at the turn of the century, the confident and optimistic search for hidden fundamentals and their place within what Freud, with characteristic overstatement, called 'underworlds'; and second, that the driving motor in this mentality, even when it was experienced as art, was scientific. Amazingly, the backbone of the century was already in place.

#### Half way house
- 
> One reason for the German preeminence in the realm of thought was her universities, which produced so much of the chemistry of the nineteenth century and were at the forefront of biblical scholarship and classical archaeology, not to mention the very concept of the Ph.D., which was born in Germany.
- Karl Pribram's "World Views" - universalism and individualism. Vienna, though was individualist, was still dominated by Catholic church and therefore universalist too. Hence, "half way house"
- Franz Brentano: philosophy going in cycles. This led to Husserl's phenomenology and Christian Von's theory of Gestalt
- 'Analytic' school started by Bertrand Russell and Wittgenstein; in contrast with the continental school fathered by Husserl (and including Heidegger, Sartre etc.).

#### Darwin's heart of darkness
