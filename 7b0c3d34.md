# Types of Guilt

## Listless guilt
- vague feeling that you should do (or be) be something but aren't. You're not sure what that thing exactly is. 


## Pointed guilt
- Guilt which is linked with doing/being something in particular. 
- "I've been putting off calling my friends for weeks now. Not cool."
- "Should" is a common source of pointed guilt. (see <f655f141>)
