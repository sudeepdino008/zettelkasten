# Deciding what to do

- My problem never has been lack of interests. It's been choosing from a bewildering range of interests.
- Digging further, the problem has been that I'm looking for something unrealistic when working on my interests. The image of filthy bearded fellows working in a congested garage comes to mind. It's not the most esthetic scene, but the image of those the Wozniaks and Stew Nelsons chipping away makes me think they're really enjoying it (which they are). But I only see the good parts, I don't see the drive and the frustrations. Happiness is not the lone outcome of working on something and exploring it. A mix is present - drive, exasperation, desire to take it easy or move on to something else. It's all a part of that.
- I think then when deciding what to do:
  -  just pick up something, anything. 
  -  Then spend some time on it (maybe use pomodoro). This is important because when you start, you're in a rut. You might not have worked on it for a while, or you might face a challenge etc. You need someway to just stick to it and gather momentum.
  -  Tentative step: I think after having worked on it for a pomodoro unit, if you still don't feel like working further on it, move on to something else. It's probably not the day for it.
  -  Once you have the momentum, go deep. Go long. Keep going. Resist the voice of "that's enough" a couple of times before actually being done working on it for a while.
- That's it! Keep it interesting, mix it up. Follow multiple similar pursuits. No need to plan out each day for the next couple of months.
- Chores are often [[[6b459e59]]]. They're a never ending stream (see [[[8d944316]]]). The key is to keep finishing bits from across all the streams you're catering to.
