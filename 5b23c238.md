# Digital Signatures

- Generate key pair: public key (pk) and private key (sk) - from random number (uses elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (EDCSA)... y^2 = x^3 + 7)
- signature - creates digital signature (Sig) from message (m) and private key (sk)
- verification - verifies if a signature (Sig) is valid for a message (m) and a public key (pk).

```python
(sk, pk) = generate_keys(key_size)
sig = sign (sk, message)
is_valid = verify(sig, pk, message)
```


## properties
- infeasible to find private key (sk) from public key (pk).
- only I can make it, but anyone can verify it.
- the signature cannot be reused - it is tied to a specific document.
- does not have to be deterministic
