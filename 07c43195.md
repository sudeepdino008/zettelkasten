# better directory navigation

## pushd and popd

Resource: [link](https://www.howtogeek.com/659146/how-to-use-pushd-and-popd-on-linux/)

- cd or pushd pushes into the stack. The top of the stack is the current directory.
- `dirs -vl` to checkout the stack.
- Another way to check the stack is `pushd`, though that'll swap the first two elements on the stack.
- to change to an arbitrary directory in stack, calculate index diff (negative is fine too), and pushd: `pushd +0` rotates the stack by 1 places, `pushd +1` rotates by 2 places and so on.

```bash
> dirs -vl
0	/Users/sudeepkumar
~
> cd ~/Documents
~/Documents
> dirs -vl
0	/Users/sudeepkumar/Documents
1	/Users/sudeepkumar
~/Documents
> pushd ~/Downloads
~/Downloads ~/Documents ~
~/Downloads
> dirs -vl
0	/Users/sudeepkumar/Downloads
1	/Users/sudeepkumar/Documents
2	/Users/sudeepkumar
~/Downloads
> pushd +1
~/Documents ~ ~/Downloads
~/Documents


```
