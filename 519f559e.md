# Blockchain


what are the desing features - cryptography, append-only timestamped blocks, distributed consensus algorithms, and networking - of Bitcoin, the first use case for blockchain technology?
how information passes around (networking) in the bitcoin nodes?


The 3 things powering cryptocurrencies are:
- cryptography: hash functions, asymmetric key and digital signatures.
- [[[a715685d]]]
- transactions


## cryptographic hash functions
- **definition**: digital fingerprint of data
- properties:
  - has to be fast
  - has to be deterministic (same output for a data x)
  - preimage resistant (one-way): infeasible to get x from Hash(x)
  - collision resistant: infeasible to find x and y such that Hash(x) == Hash(y)
  - avalanche effect: for a slight change in data, the Hash changes dramatically
- Bitcoin hash functions:
  - headers and merkle trees: SHA-256
  - bitcoin adresses: SHA-256 and RIPEMD160: making it much more difficult to crack.

### asymmetric key and digital signatures
#### digital signature algorithms
- Generate key pair: public key (pk) and private key (sk) - from random number (uses elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (EDCSA)... y^2 = x^3 + 7)
- signature - creates digital signature (Sig) from message (m) and private key (sk)
- verification - verifies if a signature (Sig) is valid for a message (m) and a public key (pk).

#### properties
- infeasible to find private key (sk) from public key (pk).


## Block
the information present is:
- version: doesn't change much
- previous block hash
- merkle root hash: dependent only on the transactions in the block.
- timestamp
- difficulty target: revised every 2 weeks
- nonce: random "number used once"

Light node or wallet doesn't download all the transaction that happened in history of blockchain. It only downloads the header.

## bitcoin addresses
- SHA-256 and RIPEMD160: making it much more difficult to crack.

## transactions
format:
- Input -> Output
- Input: previous transaction Id; index; signature
- Output: Value (in satoshi: 10^8 = 1 bitcoin); Public key


## blockchain or mining economics
- terra-hash
- mining pools


## Currency
