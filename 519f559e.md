# Blockchain


what are the desing features - cryptography, append-only timestamped blocks, distributed consensus algorithms, and networking - of Bitcoin, the first use case for blockchain technology?
how information passes around (networking) in the bitcoin nodes?


The 3 things powering cryptocurrencies are:
- [[[de7b6dbb]]]: [[[f08014e4]]], asymmetric key and digital signatures.
- [[[a715685d]]]
- transactions





## Block
the information present is:
- version: doesn't change much
- previous block hash
- merkle root hash: dependent only on the transactions in the block.
- timestamp
- difficulty target: revised every 2 weeks
- nonce: random "number used once"

Light node or wallet doesn't download all the transaction that happened in history of blockchain. It only downloads the header.

## bitcoin addresses
- SHA-256 and RIPEMD160: making it much more difficult to crack.

## transactions
format:
- Input -> Output
- Input: previous transaction Id; index; signature
- Output: Value (in satoshi: 10^8 = 1 bitcoin); Public key


## blockchain or mining economics
- terra-hash
- mining pools
