# Blockchain

- append-only timestamped log
- tamper resilient data structure (store) for information committed to it.


what are the design features - cryptography, append-only timestamped blocks, distributed consensus algorithms, and networking - of Bitcoin, the first use case for blockchain technology?
how information passes around (networking) in the bitcoin nodes?
- different kinds of blockchain? what are the pros and cons of each?
- blockchain vulnerabilities and [concerns](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/#miscellanea-and-concerns)



The 3 things powering cryptocurrencies are:
- [[[de7b6dbb]]]: [[[f08014e4]]], asymmetric key and digital signatures.
- [[[a715685d]]]
- transactions


## Block
in context of bitcoin, the information present is:
- version: doesn't change much
- previous block hash
- merkle root hash: dependent only on the transactions in the block.
- timestamp
- difficulty target: revised every 2 weeks
- nonce: random "number used once"
- transactions


- Light node or wallet doesn't download all the transaction that happened in history of blockchain. It only downloads the header.
- #transactions can be 1 or more [atleast the mining reward would be there.]

## bitcoin addresses
- SHA-256 and RIPEMD160: making it much more difficult to crack.

## transactions
format:
    - Input -> Output
    - Input: previous transaction Id; index; signature
    - Output: Value (in satoshi: 10^8 = 1 bitcoin); Public key

data present:
    - metadata: hash. size, #inputs, #outputs
    - inputs: previous output signature (except mining reward)
    - outputs: value of output; a Bitcoin Script script - programmable money

transactions are possible via [[[5b23c238]]] and help ensure that no random person can initiate transactions from your account.

### Bitcoin Script
- brings the concept of programmable money to life
- transaction specifies a script to execute
- The bitcoin scripting language:
  - stack based language
  - not turning complete: purposefully done to prevent DDoS attacks via infinite loops
  - native support for cryptographic functions.
  
### Proof of Burn
- establishes that a token is destroyed.
- return false from script, effectively proving that you can never access the UTXO again.
- why? destroy bitcoin to get some other token. (e.g. counter party tokens)

### specifying receivers
- P2PKH: pay to public key hash
- P2SH: pay to script hash
- other formats are there, but are either deprecated or not much used or new. Like P2WPKH - pay to witness public key hash




## blockchain or mining economics
- terra-hash
- mining pools


## Blockchain related data structures and concepts

### Merkle Damgard Transforms 
- chunk data into blocks (padding if necessary)
- result from previous blocok along with current block to produce a new output
- `h(prev_block_hash, curr_block_data) = curr_block_hash` where h is the hash function (compressing); `prev_block_hash` and `curr_block_hash` has size m, and `curr_block_Data` has size n where m < n.



### how decentralized in bitcoin?
- bitcoin network itself - decentralised, anyone can run a node
- mininig - somewhat centralised; open but hard to do profitably
- updating protocol/rules - somewhat centralised; vast majority use bitcoin core.

### distributed consensus
- [[[a715685d]]]


### Incentives for honest nodes
- block rewards: valid only if it's on the longest block => incentive to work on the longest chain.
- every 4 years, block rewards half
- transaction fees: transactions with higher transaction fees are preferred by miners.
