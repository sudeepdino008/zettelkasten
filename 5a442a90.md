# How to take notes

1. why?  
Do you want to take notes to understand a subject OR create something. For the former it's okay to just outline the key ideas and have good references. For the latter, you would want to take extensive notes in your own words. 


2. Interrupting the reading flow?  
While reading, take the notes/highlight in the medium itself. You can just let it stay there (without brining it to note taking tool) if you want to just rediscover the notes when rereading. Or if you want to bring it to a note taking tool, do so at the end of the book.

3. Import your ideas in your note taking system  
Or just let it stay in the book itself. Books should be a source of joy, and sticking rigidly to a note taking discipline can take a lot of fun out of it. It's ok to not import the notes/highlights of a few books, and just have it lying around in kindle or paperbacks.


Taking notes doesn't have to be a chore. Consider what your goals are. Reading a book should be an enjoyable experience.
