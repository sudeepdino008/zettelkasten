## [Predicting the future of web 2020-2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24tQRwIRP_w)

One strategy to choose your tech stack is *choose boring technology*. This is still a bet, and can fail. Example is perl, which won the popularity contest for a while but then petered out. 
Prediction is better than following. Following are the predictions made: 

1. **Typescript**
Will continue to grow popular and eventually might have more people writing typescript than javascript.  
2. **Web assembly**
Will not be adopted because it makes things fast (one of those things where people are ok with the status-quo).  
Instead, it'll expand the idea of what a web-app means (rather than replacing anything). It'll allow running heavy-native apps, video games etc. on browser. Example: [Figma uses it](https://www.figma.com/blog/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x/).
3. **Web ecosystem**
npm lasts, surviving vulnerabilties etc.
4. **Compile-to-JS**
There are javascript dialects - coffeescript, typescript. These can be compiled to javascript.  
and compile-to-js languages which are completely different - clojurescript, elm.


There was also some marketing of Elm - "Imagine if, in your life building web UIs...things usually worked" compared to javascript where things break a lot.
