# proper use of humility


- Humility can be misunderstood very easily.
- Do not use humility to say that I cannot do a certain thing because I'm not aware of it (and that someone else should do it)
- Or do not use it as an excuse to settle at less confidence than what is viable. For example, not writing unit tests because you can never be sure if the code won't break
- There's nothing wrong in acknowledging that you are limited and lacking skill in something; Now tell me what you're going to do about it?
- Do not bask in the glory of your flaws.

- Humility is hard - [[[8498566d]]]
