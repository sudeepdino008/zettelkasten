# Projection bias

This is a bias equivalent of "short-sightedness". When taking current decisions (which has future implications), we tend to project our current emotions to the future i.e. people's estimations are contaminated by their current emotional state. For example, after a student fails his exams, ze is likely to underestimate how much ze will enjoy a party 3 weeks from the results.  
Projection bias can arise from **empathy gaps** - basically when a person fail to take the future psychological state into account.
A similar concept is Personality neglect, which refers to a person's tendency to overlook their personality when making decisions about future emotions.  
Projection bias influences the lifecycle of consumption. The immediate utility obtained from consuming the project exceeds the future utility. So people tend to consume too much early in life, and too little late in life, relative to what would be optimal.

## Hot cold empathy Gap
It's a cognitive bias which happens because we underestimate the influence of visceral emotions (anger, hunger, drug addition etc.) on their attitudes, behavior and preferences. One important aspect of this idea is that human understanding is "state-independent". For example: when you are angry, it's difficult to imagine what it's like to be calm and vice versa.  
Hot-cold empathy gaps can be analyzed by their direction:
- Hot to cold: People under visceral influences find it difficult to estimate how much their short term goals align with long term goals.
- Cold to hot: Difficulty in imagining oneself in a hot state. The motivational strength of visceral strength can be minimized. Unpreparedness (when visceral emotions actually arise) is another effect.
