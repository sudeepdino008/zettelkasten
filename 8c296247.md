# How to Read a Book

**Repeated reading** has proved to work really well. 

### Reading a chapter/Book

1. Read the chapter summary or wiki for that chapter.
2. Flip thro' the pages.
3. Go through the quizzes
4. Go through again looking at the bold prints.
5. `Skim`  
Go through the 1st and last sentence of each paragraph (aim being exposure and not comprehension).
6. `Scan`
In the second pass, read the text carefully. [Or go for a second denser skim (called scanning) if the chapter was too complex]
7. `Explore References`  
In the 3rd pass, skim the bibliographic/reference sections, note anything worth exploring.
8. Repeat from 1 for things found in references.


### Reading at the right pace
- Some books are meant to be skimmed through, some books are supposed to be savored, some books are supposed to be digested. 
- The goal is to skim through a lot of books and dig into those worth it.

### BFS vs DFS
A useful idea for exploring the references is to be a specialist, rather than a generalist - To just follow through a single topic rather than run off on tangentials. It helps by not making you overwhelmed.
