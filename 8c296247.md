# How to Read a Book

**Repeated reading** has proved to work really well. There are various variations on it. 

Go through the wikipedia or summary notes from some website, to understand in detail what the book is about.

Reading a chapter:
- Read the chapter summary or wiki for that chapter.
- Flip thro' the pages.
- Go through the quizzes
- Go through again looking at the bold prints.
- Go through the 1st and last sentence of each paragraph (aim being exposure and not comprehension).

**Reading at the right pace**
- Some books are meant to be skimmed through, some books are supposed to be savored, some books are supposed to be digested. 
- The goal is to skim through a lot of books and dig into those worth it.
