# Emergency Savings Fund

- As the name suggests, this is for emergency situations like if home needs repair or you've to get off work (unemployment or illness)
- You might wanna cover yourself for about 4 months.
- It should include some important expenses:
1. Rent and maintainence. (about 15-17k)
2. Food (about 3k)
3. Insurance (if you're unemployed, are you still on the ex-employer's health plan? Should you buy a new one?)
4. Debt repayment (30k currently)
5. Transportation (3k)
6. Other personal expenses: household supplies, clothes etc. (4k)
7. Parents (20k)

- The total of this comes around 75k.
- For 4-6 months, this comes about **4Lakhs**.
- The next question is where to keep this money. It can either go in savings account or in some money market account. If going for the later, the investment mode should be safe/stable like FD, it should also be possible to take out the money quickly (2-3 days is fine)
