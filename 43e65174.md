# Celebrity fan-huddle


- Though the title seems to have a negative connotation, looking up to the people who have 'got along, and got ahead' is one of the major sources of inspiration for humans.
- When looking at a celebrity to follow, physical dominance, success and prestige is what we are looking for. The first of these are more applicable to chimpanzees though.
- In the hunter gatherer society, having a necklace of saber-toothed tiger's tooth around you neck would signal success, and it makes sense to copy this since it's a symbolic form of success. You can draw a parallel to the modern ferraris, tatooes, gold chain, are today's equivalent of these attention-magnetizing displays.
- We just don't rely on our sense of who's skilful and successful when we work out who to copy. We are high social and we tend to look to other people to determine who's worthy of attention. It's found that kids start mimicking as early as 14 months. 
- The humans consist of a local frequency vocal band at 500Hz which was long considered useless because when the higher frequencies were filtered out, all that was left was a informationless hum. It's since been discovered that this hum is actually 'an unconscious social instrument' - The dominant person in a social situation tends to set the level of hum and everyone just adjusts theirs to match it.
- When we see someone adoring a celebrity, we naturally become intrigued. We're naturally attracted to prestige cues and tend to follow them at an early age.
- **Paris Hilton effect**: Because we're wired to direct our attention towards people who are already subject of the attention, we'll be drawn to people in the media. This creates more attention for the person on the news, and creates a feedback loop, a runaway spiral.
