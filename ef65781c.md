# Confidence

- Relationships can be of two types - hierarchical or horizontal. 
- In hierarchical relationships, you consider someone to be higher or lower than you. 
- Hierarchical relationships are false games - The notion that there's levels of importance, and each individual is assigned some level depending on ability, age, money, wisdom etc.
- Even if you consider yourself to be at the top, there's pressure to stay there. While if you place others above you, there's lots of anxiety as you seek to overcome your position and move ahead. It's a game you can't win.
- True Confidence can never be a product of comparison. It's only a product of indifference. Realize that nothing truly matters in life, for you are a fleeting existence.
- If you really wish to do something, do it for the sake of **experiencing** it and not for "meaning" and "purpose" - which are constructions in your brain.
- People want to be applauded or thought highly of. But this often renders them actors on stage, playing a role to garner attention and praise. If you are indifferent, confidence will not be an issue.
