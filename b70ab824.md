# Rust: Fearless Concurrency

- using threads: `thread::spawn` spawns a new thread and unjoins it from the parent thread i.e. no lifecycle dependence, except when main thread itself is terminated, in which case the whole program and all the threads in it are killed.
- `move` : force thread to take ownership

## message passing
- **channels** are constructed, which can transmit data between **transmitter** and **receiver**
- if either party is dropped, channel is closed.
- `std::sync::mpsc` : multiple producer, single consumer
- transmit data: `tx.send(...)`
- receive data: `rx.recv(...)` or `rx.try_rec(...)` 
- you'll need to clone the transmitters to use multiple producers

```rust

fn channels_multiple() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let vals = vec![String::from("hi"), String::from("bye")];

        for val in vals {
            tx.send(val).unwrap();
        }
    });

    for received_value in rx {
        println!("got {}", received_value);
    }
}
```

## shared state concurrency
- `mutex` is used
- strong claim - "thanks to rust's type system and ownership rules, you can't get locking and unlocking wrong"
- using mutex in different threads - use `Rc<T>`
- ownership transfer between threads need to have `Send` trait. `Rc` doesn't have this and so is thread unsafe.
- thread safe version of `Rc` is `Arc`

#### Send trait
- `Send` marks a type as thread safe, and so its ownership can be transferred between threads.
- most types have send trait. `Rc` is not one of them.
- All types composed entirely of `Send` types aer marked automatically as `Send` as well.
- all primitive types have `Send` trait, except raw pointers.

#### Sync trait
- allowing access from multiple threads.
- indicates that this particular type is safe to be referenced from multiple threads.
- examples: 
  - YES: Mutex, primitive types, types composed entirely of types that are `Sync`
  - No: `Rc`, `RefCell` 
  
  
```rust

fn shared_memory2() {
    let mutex = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for i in 1..10 {
        let mutex2 = Arc::clone(&mutex);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = mutex2.lock().unwrap();
            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("value is {}", *mutex.lock().unwrap());
}

fn shared_memory() {
    let m = Mutex::new(5);
    {
        let mut num = m.lock().unwrap();
        *num = 6;
    }

    println!("m is {:?}", m);
}
```



## locks

- `Mutex<T>` is used to take locks. `.lock()` method will take the lock. The unlocking method is automatic - based on the lifetime of `MutexGuard<T>` within the `LockResult<MutexGuard<T>>`. 
- so you've to be careful to release the lock once you've received the data. For example:
```rust
let thread = thread::spawn(move || {
            while let Ok(job) = receiver.lock().unwrap().recv() {
                println!("Worker {} got a job; executing.", id);

                job();
            }
        });
```
this won't work because `while let` holds the temporary values created by the right side of the expression. So here, the temp value of `receiver.lock()` is held till the end of the while, which means that other spawned threads won't be able to acquire the lock.
