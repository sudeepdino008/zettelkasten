# Haskell: Types and Typeclasses

- The type (`:t <expression>`) for a function makes no distinction between parameters and arguments (because of currying):

```haskell
ghci> :t threeArgFunc
threeArgFunc :: Num a => a -> a -> a -> a
```

the `::` is read as "has type of"

- Polymorphic functions: Functions whose type is composed of a type variable (representing "any" type - similar to generics in other languages, but more general)
- [typeclasses](http://learnyouahaskell.com/types-and-typeclasses): Define a set of functions that have different implementation depending on the type of data they are given. [Kinda seems like protocols, not sure how it's different.]  
Use **type annotations** to remove ambiguity. It allows to specify the type:
```haskell
read "5" + 4.2
9.2n

read "5"
<Error>

read "5" :: Float   -- type annotations
```
