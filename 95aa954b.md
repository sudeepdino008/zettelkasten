# Why functional programming matters

- The obvious purpose of programming languages is to create things. 
- The idea behind the promotion of functional programming languages is that it has better support for **modularity** which makes it easy to write concise code.
- The examples provided in this paper include higher-order functions which makes it super-easy to perform operations on collections like list. 
- The other feature that allows modularization is lazy evaluation, which allows notions like streams. It also allows to create complex data structures like tableau (which allows series to rapidly converge).  
Another example is that lazy evaluation allows a different representation for loops - separating the termination conditions from loop bodies, this is a powerful modularization.
```haskell
evens = [1,2,3,...].filter(n%2==0)
```
- Languages like c++ introduce modularity with classes or namespaces, but this is not good enough. FP languages provide more ways of modularity which are making its way into languages like java (stream structures or lazily evaluation classes), but the issue is that these very important features are second-class citizens. FP allows using these features much more easily.
