# Design Paradigms

## Convention over Configuration ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration))

- It's a design paradigm which seeks to decrease the number of decisions a user/developer has to make. It's related to concepts like "sensible defaults".
- It conflicts with principles like the [Zen of Python's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python) "explicit is better than implicit"
