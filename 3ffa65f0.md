# Find your Cato(s)


- Cato was a legendary Roman politician and warrior whose example reverberated in the works of many stoics who followed him.
- He's an example of the overseer - a guiding light, someone who looks over your shoulder, judging your work, and recognising if you bullshit yourself.


# Cato 1: Elizer Yudowsky

- He's my Cato. Although he'd probably argue that this assignment means nothing (and is actually another distraction) if I don't actually apply the concept of Cato.
- I cam envision him berating me when I've erred in decision, and sided with comfort and biases. I think I can even train my mind to invoke him whenever I'm jarred by some irrational thought progression.
