# Django: Authentication

- what is stored in sessions and how it works?
- once you've logged in, can you do stuff you don't have permission for (if you don't implement an explicit blocking of action) - if you don't implement, it'll just go through. You need to use, say `permission_required` decorator. 
- what's the authentication middleware's role in all of this?


authentication: process by which system recognises that the user is who he claims to be.  
authorization: process by which an authenticated user is allowed to do operations he's been granted.  

auth system consists of: users, permissions, groups, password hashing system, forms and view tools for logging in users or restricting content

- authentication support is bundled in `django.contrib.auth` and `django.contrib.contenttypes` (the django content type system, which allows permissions to be associated with models you create)
- The middleware on the other hand has: `SessionMiddleware` (managed sessions across requests) and `AuthenticationMiddleware` (associates users with requests using sessions)  
- with these settings in place you can do `migrate` to create the necessary database tables for auth related models and permissions for any models defined in your installed apps.

- `django.contrib.auth.User` is the central class, `create_user` is used to create it. Password hashes are stored so you should never modify them directy, use `set_password()` for it. Password can also be changed from django admin or manage.py; django also provides views and forms to allow users to change their password.

- `user_permissions` can be create/delete/change/add/view etc. `User` objects have two many-to-many fields: `groups` and `user_permissions`.
- the default permissions created are : add, change, delete, view.
- `Groups` is a generic way of categorising users so you can apply permissions, or some other label, to those users. A user in a group is automatically granted permissions to that group.

- `django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend`: default authentication backend used by django. It authenticates using credentials consisting of a user identifier and password. You can check permissions for a user or authenticate a user using this.  
Note that permission for a user is cached after the first time they are fetched, so any change in permissions means that the user needs to be refetched to have it reflected in the instance.

## custom permissions
- can be directly created:
```python
content_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(BlogPost)
permission = Permission.objects.create(
    codename='can_publish',
    name='Can Publish Posts',
    content_type=content_type,
)
```
then use `user_permissions` (User) or `permissions` (Group) attribute to assign this custom permission.
- other way to create custom permissions is using `Meta` 

## secret keys
- generate new secret key:
```python
>>> from django.core.management import utils
>>> print(utils.get_random_secret_key())
```

## authentication in web requests
- django uses sessions and middleware to hook the authentication system into request objects.
- `HttpRequest` has a user field which provides properties like `is_authenticated`
- manual way to login a user: you can use `django.contrib.auth.login` function - this saves the user id and backend used for authentication in the user's session. You can see if the provided username and password is authenticated using `authenticate` function.
- similarly in the manual way, use `logout` method to log a user out and clear the user session.
- the cool way: use the `@login_required` decorator. If the user isn't logged in, it redirects to `settings.LOGIN_URL` and passes the current absolute path in the query string (?next=etc).
- `user_passes_text` is a decorator which can be passed a test function. It's a convenience decorator which does redirecting on its own.

- to check if a user has a particular permission, use `permission_required` decorator.
- for class based views, all of this decorators have corresponding Mixins, which should be used.

## authentication views
- django provides several views that you can use for handling login, logout, password recovery etc. They make use of stock auth forms but you can pass in your own forms as well.
- django provides no default template for authentication views.
