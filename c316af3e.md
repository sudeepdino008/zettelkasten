# Dissent

- Being a dissenter is a valuable social service, because conformity is an extremely strong force specially when no one is taking the contrary view. See [Asch's Conformity Experiment](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WHK94zXkQm7qm7wXk/asch-s-conformity-experiment)

## Difficulties of Dissent

- Now being a dissenter (particularly) comes with its own social implications. In ancient days you would be burned to the stake for being the first (or second) person to point that the Emperor has no clothes. In recent, and possibly more relevant situations, being a dissenter means you are the lone nail sticking out of an otherwise harmonious group.

- When alone, people tend to doubt their abilities a bit more - "Can I do this?". There's nothing impolite about doubting your own incompetence. But in group it's polite to be more optimistic and say encouraging words, and it is impolite to consider other person's incompetence.
  
- There are standards ways to rebel. For example: following a minority group, but not being the sole member of it. Our brain has not evolved for the purpose of leaving the group and wandering off into a jungle. In the Asch's conformity experiment, the first dissenter was rare to come by; However, once there was a dissenter, it was easier for people to follow the lead.  
Do not seek to rebel for the sake of it.

## When to Dissent

### How do you identify if you are dissenting for the right reasons? 
- Is what you are dissenting against adversely (or unfairly) effect a person or group.
- Do you think people are agreeing too readily, and there's actually a hidden point worth brining out? - Often happens in meetings where a con of an otherwise accepted solution is worth discussing.
- Are you really convinced? - The default stance should be to doubt your understanding and see if you can ask questions about it. What's the confusion?
- If it's uncomfortable for the present, think if letting go has any future impact i.e. if it's a time-bomb. It's worth dissenting right there.

### When is dissenting not the right choice?
- When you are already emotionally worked up about some issue.
- When the other person is there for parody, in a restricted environment, and everyone clearly knows ze's joking.
- If it gets you lynched.

### What kind of shitstorm do you expect to face when you rebel?
