# Cryptocurrency: Mining

## being a miner
- listen for transactions (maintain tx pool)
- maintain and update blockchain (listen for new blocks)
- assemble a candidate block
- solve the puzzle
- broadcast your block (and hope others accpet it)
- this is going to geenrate a new transaction which gets send to the address you control.


## finding a valid block
- optimise for highest transaction fees - more transactions, highest fees for transaction.
- is only limited transactions possible in a block?

- different ways to modify the hash and try to solve the puzzle for that - try different nonces (from 0 to 2^32-1); or choose different transaction list; or use different reward address; modify timestamp
- when candidate block is found, broadcast it ASAP to the network! (some exceptions exist)

- how do I know the target:
calculated every 2016 blocks  
```python

next_difficulty = (prev_difficulty * 2016 * 10 minutes) / time_to_mine_last_2016_blocks
difficulty = maximim_possible_target / current_target
target = maximum_possible_target / difficulty

```

## CPU/GPU Mining:
- `hash(block) = SHA256(SHA256(block))`
- "One CPU, one vote"
- on a regular desktop or laptop, you can get several tens of millions of hashes per second.
- Around 2010s, GPU programming became popular. They can parallelize relatively simple operations.
- GPUs increased hashpower by approximately an order of magnitude over a CPU; and you could run multiple GPUs off a single computer - the era of *mining rigs*.
- Brief reign of FPGAs (programmable integrate circuits) - this gave another order of magnitude increase in performance, but prone ot failure and constly.
- ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits): 2012 to Now - specialized computers that can do nothing BUT mine Bitcoin

## Energy Consumption
- Today it's at ~73 TWh/year (approximately equivalent to Austria)
- Could we increase efficiency?
  - yup, we've already seen that. It's a Red Queen's Race (have to go faster just to stay still)
  - plus, limits of efficiency - Landauer's Principle
  - there are other systems that don't use PoW (later)
- Mining = securing the networkl under bitcoin's rules, the security of a network comes from the vast amount of hashing that is being done.

## Mining Pools
- collection of miners run by a pool manager
- reduce variance 
- how do you know that you're contributing to pool? - turn in near misses AND hits (only way to generate these is by using hashpower). The entry is a "share" in the next block reward: pool manager can get a good idea of your hashpower.
- can pools be too powerful? - GHash.IO briefly had > 50% of hashpower in 2014, but reduced it intentionally.
- hash laundering: super-powerful miners be hiding their actual hashpower by joining multiple pools.

## Attack by miners
- forking attack: requires huge amount of hashpower. You can incentivize others to build on your fork by including transactions with high fees etc.
- block withholding: you hold the block you mined, and start solving the next block, making you possibly 2 block aheads of the entire networks. "selfish mining"
- blacklisting / punitive porking - if you've sufficient mining power, you can blacklist certain UTXOs or address; and blackmail other miners to not include it else their blocks won't be considered valid by us.
- feather attack: you'll attempt to fork, but eventually give up if you can't do it. Probability of success is `a^2` where `a` is the your hashpower fraction in the network.
