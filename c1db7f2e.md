# Stocks and Bonds

Two ways by which money can raise money - Stocks (company is selling shares) and Bonds (company is taking debts)

## Stocks 
- what does it mean when you have shares/stocks in a company?
- part *owner* of the company
- Company has assets worth some amount (it's a different question how that amount is decided)
- Company also has some liabilities (debts etc.)
- If company were sold now, what's left for the owner is: `Assets worth - liabilties`  
This is called `Equity`.
- If company has *n* number of shares, then the share value is `Equity/n`. If someone was offering shares less than this value, we might buy it, if offered more, we might sell it.

## Bonds
- part *lender* to the company
- You are providing debt to the company.
- It's a way for a company to raise capital. You're essentially raising money from public market.
- Parallel to a stock here is a `bond certificate` (having face value $X). This is as IOU, which says that at maturity, the company will pay $X for each bond certificate.
- You usually would be buying a bond certificate at $Y, in which case your net profit across the investment period is $Y-$X (this is interest).

### What happens when the company decides to liquidate its assets (maybe because the business doesn't make sense anymore)?
- Who gets paid first? The Bond owners or the stock owners?
