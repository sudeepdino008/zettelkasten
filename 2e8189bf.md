# Taking averages in confusion

Sometimes when we're confused between two choices, we tend to take averages of the two actions and follow that. This makes no sense - either the model 1 is correct, in which case commit to that; or model 2 is correct, and you should commit to that.  
For example: your friend shows up at your door, but you had an assignment to do. Instead you decide to hangout, while simulataneously feeling bad about not doing that assignment.
