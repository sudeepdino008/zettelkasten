# Django: Web development framework

django projects can host multiple apps. An app can be used with multiple django projects - apps are "pluggable"


asgi.py:  
wsgi.py: gateway interface used for deployment (??)  
admin.py: configuration file for built-in Django app called django admin  
view.py: handles the request/response cycle of web application  

models : essentially data model - essential fields and behaviors of the data you're storing.
```bash
## manage.py: a shortcut to use django-admin command-line utility

## whenever the model is changed, run this to create migrations for those changes.
python manage.py makemigrations

## apply those changes to the database
python manage.py migrate

```

- useful to have `__str__()` method to your models, because string representations are used throughout Django's automatically-generated admin.



## commands
```bash
## start a new project
django-admin startproject <project-name>

## create a new app
django-admin startapp boards


python manage.py show_urls
```


## models
```python

# django gives a predefined user.
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

```

### reverse relationship on foreign key.
- e.g. you have a foreign key to Board in Post. The Post belongs to one Board. Django automatically generates the reverse relationship - the posts any Board contains. It's available under the name of `related_name` or `(class_name)_set` e.g. Board.post_set  
- to ignore the reverse relationship, set the `related_name='+'`


### the shell interface
```python
python manage.py shell


## create objects
>>> from boards.models import Board
>>> board1 = Board(name='Django', description='Ask questions about Django - the web development framework')
>>> board2 = Board.objects.create(name='Blog', description='Find blogging tips and tricks here')

## save
board1.save()

## get 
Board.objects.get(id=1)


```


## templates
- define html templates, with some placeholder variables where values can be plugged in from app views. 
- add the template directory in `TEMPLATES` variable in `settings.py`
- It uses the django template language, which is similar to other text-based template languages like Smarty or Jinja2

## static files setup
[static files in django](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/2017/09/11/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-django-part-2.html)
- configure the static files directory in `settings.py`.
- use the static files app template tags in template html


## django admin
A good use case of the Django Admin is for example in a blog; it can be used by the authors to write and publish articles. Another example is an e-commerce website, where the staff members can create, edit, delete products.


## configure a custom Model from django admin
```python
# in admin.py, add
admin.site.register(<Model name>)
```

## URLs
project can have many urls (in fact each app has a URLConf), but there has to be a `root` URLConf  
Angled brackets can be used to capture url parameters:

```python
## excerpt from urls.py
path('boards/<int:board_id>/', views.fetch_board, name='fetch_board'),

## excerpt from views.py
def fetch_board(request, board_id):
    board = Board.objects.get(id=board_id)
    return render(request, 'topics.html', {'board': board})

```

### PK or ID?
PK stands for primary key. All django models have this attribute. Most models automatically create an AutoField named id, which can be access either by `pk` or `id`.  
You might setup a different primary key by setting say `email` as the primary key, which can be accessed by using either `obj.email` or `obj.pk`

## Forms API
- Forms are way to deal with user input. There are validation and security issues to take care of and the forms API provides a clean way to handle this.  
- available in modules `django.forms`: `Form` is used to process data not directly associated with a model in our application; while `ModelForm` is associated with a model class    
- `{{ form.as_p }}` can be used to render the django form in HTML. There are other methods like `as_table` and `as_ul`
- There's a `UserCreationForm` (which inherits from `ModelForm` class) to handle the creation of new users. It has 3 fields - username, password1, password2
- rendering bootstrap forms: you can use django package called *django-widget-tweaks* to make things look good.
