# Django: Web development framework

django projects can host multiple apps. An app can be used with multiple django projects - apps are "pluggable"


asgi.py:
wsgi.py:


models : essentially data model - essential fields and behaviors of the data you're storing.
```bash
## whenever the model is changed, run this to create migrations for those changes.
python manage.py makemigrations

## apply those changes to the database
python manage.py migrate

```

- useful to have `__str__()` method to your models, because string representations are used throughout Django's automatically-generated admin.
