# Types of Relationships

- Relationships can be of two types - hierarchical or horizontal. 
- In hierarchical relationships, you consider someone to be higher or lower than you. 
- Hierarchical relationships are false games - The notion that there's levels of importance, and each individual is assigned some level depending on ability, age, money, wisdom etc.
