# Smart - having a different perspective

> You have to not have the same bag of experiences as everyone else. - Steve Jobs

You develop a different perspective by having unique life experiences. Jobs, for example, was inspired by Buddhism, which he explored in his college years. The Zen philosophy's keywords - simplicity, empathy, and mindfulness-- are not at all alien to Apple's products.  
If you want to be truly smart in today's professional world, you have to gather experiences that few others in your tribe have.
