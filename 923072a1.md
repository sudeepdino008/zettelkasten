# classic style

Different from other styles. For example, practical style, is the language of memos, manuals and term papers. Classic style is the language of science of the Dawkins and Pinkers. Classic writing assumes the reader and writer on the same level, and makes the reader feel like a genius. Bad writing makes a reader feel like a dunce.
