# Appium

[udemy course on appium](https://www.udemy.com/course/mobile-automation-using-appiumselenium-3/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=DSA_Catchall_la.EN_cc.INDIA&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_82569850245_._ad_437477497173_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-485138043266_._li_1007748_._pd__._&matchtype=b)  
[testing mobile apps with appium on aws device farm](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/testing-mobile-apps-with-cucumber-and-appium-through-testng-on-aws-device-farm/)
It's not a testing framework per se, but a framework for UI interaction. The Appium APIs for both Android and iOS are almost identical, which means if the applications are similar, your tests for the two will share most of the code.

## interesting features

- allows to test things like installing/uninstalling the app (could be useful to test login flows)
- write once, run on both the mobile platforms.
- works with cross platform languages (like flutter etc.)

## Rough stuff

- install appium desktop
- setup XCUITest driver for iOS
- setup a client (will use java-client)


check setup
- `npm install -g appium-doctor; appium-doctor`
- JAVA_HOME has to be setup: `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)`
- then appium-doctor spits out more dependencies:
```
