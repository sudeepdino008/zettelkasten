# Appium

## Introduction

- Open source mobile app testing tool that is used for mobile automation testing.
- It's not a testing framework per se, but a framework for UI interaction. The Appium APIs for both Android and iOS are almost identical, which means if the applications are similar, your tests for the two will share most of the code.


## Philosophy

### open source

### Shouldn't need to recompile the app
Use vendor provided automation frameworks under the hood - UIAutomator/XCUITest

### Shouldn't be locked into one particular language to write the automation scripts.
Wrap the vendor-provided frameworks in one API - webdriver API. The WebDriver (Appium WebDriver) specifies a client-server protocol (JSON Wire protocol) to send appropriate requests to the server (more on this later).

### Do not reinvent the wheel
Webdriver is a de facto standard for automating web browsers. Webdriver can simply be extended to include commands relevant for mobile apps, which is what happens for Appium.

## Architecture

```{.mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
    Client->>Server: Start Session with Desired Capabilities
    activate Server
    Server->>Mobile Device: Start Session
    activate Mobile Device
    Client->>Server: WebDriver commands
    Server->>Mobile Device: Native commands (UIAutomator/XCUITest)
    Mobile Device->>Server: Responses to commands
    Server->>Client: Responses back to Client
    Client->>Server: Quit
    deactivate Server
    deactivate Mobile Device
```

Go through various components - Mobile Device; Server (Appium Server); Client (python code)

## interesting features

- allows to test things like installing/uninstalling the app (could be useful to test login flows)
- write once, run on both the mobile platforms.
- works with cross platform languages (like flutter etc.)
- Appium translates selenium webdriver commands into UIAutomation/XCUITest (iOS) or UIAutomator (Android) commands depending on device type.
- Use browserstack to get the devices you want to test on (rather than relying on the simulators).


## Key Concepts

- **Desired capabilities**   
These are keys/values sent by clients to server when an automation session is requested. It provides info about what kind of session is being requested. It can be scripted in the WebDriver test or set within the appium server GUI (via an inspector session).   
The documentation is [here](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/writing-running-appium/caps.md); XCUITest specific capabilities are [here](https://github.com/appium/appium-xcuitest-driver#desired-capabilities) (for example, autolaunch? can be configured)

- **implicit waiting**
- **locator strategies**



## Writing stable appium tests
link [here](https://appiumpro.com/editions/19-making-your-appium-tests-fast-and-reliable-part-1-test-flakiness)  

1. Test flakiness might be due to any part of the automation stack (appium script, appium, WebDriver, XCUITest/UIAutomator, mobile operating system). Check where the issue exists.
2. Use the correct **Locator strategies**  
There are several [locator strategies](https://appiumpro.com/editions/20-making-your-appium-tests-fast-and-reliable-part-2-finding-elements). The preferred way is via accessibility identifiers--It's cross platform (both iOS and android have concepts of accessibility labels). The only case it might be difficult is when appium is used by testers, and need to ask their developers to provide accessibility identifiers.  
There's also predicate string strategy and class chain strategy (available as android or iOS specific methods).  
[Xpath is to be completely avoided](mnig).  
Appium desktop recommends the locator strategy in its inspection session.
3. [Waiting for app states](Waiting)  
You might often not find the elements because of race conditions between the executing appium script accessing the element AND the UI being rendered on device.    
<u>Strategies</u>:  
a. Use `Thread.sleep()`--Meh!  
b. Use implicit waits, which keeps trying to find the element for the specified interval:
    ```java
    driver.implicitly_wait(10)
    ```  
c. Explicit Wait: More fine grained control, allowing you to customize the timeout duration when locating each element.  
d. Custom explicit waits: For more complicated waits!

4. [Dealing with unfindable elements](https://appiumpro.com/editions/22-making-your-appium-tests-fast-and-reliable-part-4-dealing-with-unfindable-elements)  
Custom UI elements might be visible on screen but might still not be accessible. This is a limitation because XCUITest or UIAutomator themselves cannot locate these custom elements. One solution is to enable accessibility (see for [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/iPhoneAccessibility/Making_Application_Accessible/Making_Application_Accessible.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008785-CH102-SW4) and [Android](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/accessibility/AccessibilityNodeProvider)). The other solution is to do so by performing operations (tap, press etc.) on some coordinate.

5. [Setting up the app state](https://appiumpro.com/editions/23-making-your-appium-tests-fast-and-reliable-part-5-setting-up-app-state)
Too much time might be spent on logging in. There are several ways to mitigate this:
a. Custom android activities (for Android-only)
b. Custom launch arguments (iOS only): iOS apps can be launched with command-line flags called launch arguments. App will then need to handle these launch arguments to do UI-less login.
c. A testing screen: which can access the various parts of the app.
d. Deep Linking

6. [Mocking external services](https://appiumpro.com/editions/26-making-your-appium-tests-fast-and-reliable-part-8-mocking-external-services)  
User mock server to stub api responses. Might be problematic when you're running the tests in cloud providers (like browserstack) -- So see if it can be done there.

7. [Setting up iOS app permissions automatically](https://appiumpro.com/editions/43-setting-ios-app-permissions-automatically)

## Work log

- install appium desktop (essentially appium server)
- setup XCUITest driver for iOS
- setup a client (will use java-client)


check setup
- `npm install -g appium-doctor; appium-doctor`
- JAVA_HOME has to be setup: `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)`
- then appium-doctor spits out more dependencies:
```

```

for iOS, installing [idb](https://fbidb.io/) and [applesimutils](https://github.com/appium/appium-xcuitest-driver) as they seem relevant.  
Indeed they are! IDB is for things like setting location, while apple simulation utils allow you to use permissions capability.

- Having trouble installing the java or objc appium client. The documentation is not clear and it's a major concern. Trying out the [python client](https://github.com/appium/python-client) as it seems to have sufficiently clear documentation.  
Some ssl errors. Can't install anything via pip  
Unresolved still. Can install python client using source. But now thinking of setting up the java sample tests they have (for iOS) [here](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/sample-code/java/src/IOSBasicInteractionsTest.java)  
- Going back to python client. pyenv had some ssl issues. Installed 3.8.0 on pyenv and then installed did `python -m pip Appium-Python-Client selenium`
- Cool. Now trying to write a simple test in python (or before that, simply connect the client to server)  
python client:
```python
# iOS environment
import unittest
from appium import webdriver

desired_caps = dict(
    platformName='iOS',
    platformVersion='14.1',
    automationName='xcuitest',
    deviceName='iPhone Simulator',
    app='/Users/sudeepkumar/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/UICatalog-hbhjyiyopqrjqyepdvoermcfbeph/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/UICatalog.app'
)

driver = webdriver.Remote('http://localhost:4723/wd/hub', desired_caps)
el = driver.find_element_by_accessibility_id('item')
el.click()
```
- on `python test.py`, the client is running, and appium server connects to it, rebooting and doing a bunch of other stuff. (currently the file is in `open_source/appium/test.py`
- In appium server, you can start `inspector session`. In `automatic server` tab, select `Attach to Session...`  
I guess you can add some test cases from here, but there's some error around "ask your development team to provide accessibility identifiers". You can use this [blog](https://medium.com/the-ministry-of-testing/adding-accessibility-identifiers-to-an-ios-app-c8e09d9c20f3)  
Accessibility identifiers are preferred because you can use the same appium client code to refer to UI elements of both platforms.
- Adding accessibility identifier and doing a simple programmatic printing of its value. It worked easily!
- Next is to try the appium inspector to generate some test.
- You don't need to run the client script for this--Just start a new session

- Going for java, as it might be easier to write modularized code in it + Android folks might find it easier.
- Getting this on starting server:
```text
An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command. Original error: Could not create simulator with name 'appiumTest-2FD437AD-D66B-4B19-8729-37BAAA5B95DD-iPhone X', device type id 'iPhone X', with runtime ids 'com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-14-1', '14.1'
```
The iOS version had moved ahead after the last update. Updating it to `14.2`
- setting up [iOS app permissions automatically](permi). It uses applesimutils, which needs to be installed:
```bash
    brew tap wix/brew && brew install wix/brew/applesimutils
```
- While interacting with inspector, you might want to skip the earlier stages of interacting with app (because appium inspector is slow). Just go ahead and interact with  the app, and use "Refresh Source and Screenshot" button to update the inspector.
- Android has proven to be a completely different beast. You set the accessibility identifier by setting the field `contentDescription`. 
- It was a nightmare to interact with android system dialogues. After a wasted afternoon, I finally found a way to auto grant the permissions. This combined with swipe allowed me to breeze through the permissions process.  
Note that it didn't work for iOS.
```python
## autoGrantPermission is king!

desired_caps = dict(
    platformName='Android',
    deviceName='Android Emulator',
    app='/Users/sudeepkumar/Zendrive/mobile-apps/android/apps/copilot/build/outputs/apk/debug/copilot-debug.apk',
    fullReset=True,
    autoGrantPermissions=True)


# swipe through!
size = driver.get_window_size()
width = size['width']
height = size['height']
driver.swipe(width/2, height/2, 0, height/2, 300)

```

- found something interesting: accepting alert
```java
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent());
Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
alert.accept();

// through capabilities?
capabilities.SetCapability("autoAcceptAlerts", true);
capabilities.SetCapability("autoDismissAlerts", true);

```

- [using adb in appium](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52196841/how-to-enable-disable-app-permission-using-appium)
- build apk for android: `./gradlew copilot:assembleDebug`


- find the simulators in your machine:
```bash
applesimutils  --list | jq '.[] | {version: .os.version, name: .os.name, productFamily: .deviceType.productFamily, dname: .name} | select (.productFamily == "iPhone")'
```
Only one of these can be used for the UITest. Make sure the `platformVersion` simulator specified in desired capabilities is present in your machine.

- The system buttons have different ids in different systems:
```bash
14.3 and 14.2
//XCUIElementTypeCell[@name="Location, While Using"]
```
Skipping this problem for now. `14.x` is the latest, and that should be used.

- Next problem is to build in a neutral location, so the app path can be standardized
building from command line:
```bash
BUILD_DIR=/tmp/appium-build/
DERIVED_DATA_DIR=$BUILD_DIR/DerivedData
xcodebuild -configuration 'Debug' -workspace Copilot.xcworkspace  -scheme 'Copilot' -xcconfig command-line-build.xcconfig -derivedDataPath $DERIVED_DATA_DIR clean build
```

- The desired  capabilities only supports absolute or a URL to compressed app. Can't use  relative paths.

## Questions
- how will appium integrate into development environment? into the test environment?
- what language do we write the client in? - using java (android folks would be comfortable + static typing works better for reading code and collaborative development).
- how much time does it take to run one appium test? Can it be made faster?

## Funda
- Selenium (and Ι think Appium to provides webelements with the help of properties like ID, name, xpath etc. Selenium however doesn't offer an "object repository". Page Object Model (POΜ is a popular design pattern to create an object repository in which each one  of those webelement properties are created using a class file). See [link](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/selenium/selenium_page_object_model.htm)  

### Webdriver
resource: [python API for WebDriver](sele)  
It's the protocol that selenium and appium both use to interact with web browsers or mobile devices/simulators.  
resource: [w3c specification of webdriver](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/)  
> WebDriver is a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents. It provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of web browsers.
> Provided is a set of interfaces to discover and manipulate DOM elements in web documents and to control the behavior of a user agent. It is primarily intended to allow web authors to write tests that automate a user agent from a separate controlling process, but may also be used in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts to control a--possibly separate--browser.  
Webdriver allows you to write test scripts in a number of programming languages. It controls the browser from OS level.  
Before selenium webdriver (called selenium 2.0), there was selenium remote control (selenium 1.0), which is inferior to webdriver in several ways ([link](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-webdriver-comparison-selenium-rc.html) for details). Webdriver also allows headless (GUI-less) `HTMLUnit` browser which allows unit testing to be faster since no time is spend on waiting for the webpages to render.
