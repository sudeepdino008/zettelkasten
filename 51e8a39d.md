# Android: Navigation Component
resource: [navigation component](android )


Jetpack navigation
SafeArgs plugin to explicitly define the actions.

A **task** is a collection of activities that users interact with when performing a certain job.  
The activities are arranged in a stack--called **back stack**--in the order in which the activity was opened.

## Principles:
- Fixed start destination  
back button from start destination leads to app exit.
- Navigation state is represented as a stack of destinations. The start destination is always at the bottom of the stack. You operate on the stack of the stack, pushing or popping destinations.
- Up button (in the app bar)  and back button are identical within your app's task. Though the up button never exits the app.
- deep linking simulates manual navigation
