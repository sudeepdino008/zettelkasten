# Firestore

## Offline mode
- It's meant to allow the app to be responsive when the user goes offline for few hours, days or even months. It's not meant for permanent persistence.
- **Write**
doc updated locally, the operation is added into "pending writes", the listeners are invoked, and then write is attempted on the firestore server. If online, the write succeeds and is removed from pending writes, else pending writes are queued (one after another).  
Once online, all the pending writes are flushed to the server.  Pending writes are never evicted from the cache.
- **Read**  
If online, fetch from server. Else, apply the pending writes one by one, and then query the cache. It usually takes about a 1000 queued writes for there to be any visible slowness in offline queries. But this means that you cannot use offline mode for permanent persistence.  
LRU cache eviction policy used here. Another way a cache document can be removed is if the document was deleted (online or offline).
- Offline cache (unlike the store used in firestore backend) is not indexed, which means that each document will have to be unpacked for the query. Which means queries are slower here.
