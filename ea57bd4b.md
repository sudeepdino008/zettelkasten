# Contrary view on success

Success can be viewed as a self-created drama. Now humans feel that nothing worthwhile can be achieved without struggle. There are many things apart from a struggle which'll give you what you're struggling for.  
A person can choose the mindset of success, if he wishes to take a path of hard work and striving. This person is more interested in "struggle". People are interested in this path precisely because stuggle is a romanticised notion. It's "heroic".  
The other way is via the path of mastery. It's still an intense path, but peaceful. Closely linked to this idea is that of curiosity (<0d3bb863>). Hard work and struggle are for those who try to become that which they believe is difficult for them to attain.

- What if I stop thinking too much into success and money, and instead try to optimise on better features like curiosity, contribution and experience?
- What does the above mean? It means that you ask questions, hunt for them, look at what's interesting about them.
