# Caring about something larger than yourself
- Self is complex, a multitude of conflicting interests.
- Many of these interests (like ingroupism) was relevant for ancestral environments, but is not so relevant now. It might also infact stand against your aesthetic sense of justice and fair play (the kind of stuff Buddhism asserts).
- You might think that you don't care about people outside your social group. But is it really true? Are you confusing caring and feeling?
- It's possible to not feel anything for a person, and still care for ze (as much as you do for your friends, if not more).
- The question remains as to why you would want to do such a thing.
