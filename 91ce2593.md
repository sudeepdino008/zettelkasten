# humans are bad at estimating


- We underestimate the time needed to finish off a task. As such it's necessary to counter this by being ahead of where you think you should be.
- Put in a little extra every day (1 or 2 hours on a long project, or finish a few more small tasks) to stay on top of the sprint.
- Another important thing of course if to underpromise. It's difficult, but don't promise and then do it anyway if you have the time. (Underpromise and overdeliver)
- Have a [[6e5a2def]]
- Humans tend to be bad at taking their future emotions/personality into account when taking decisions (under visceral conditions). This is called [[77218c05]]
