# humans are bad at estimating


- We underestimate the time needed to finish off a task. As such it's necessary to counter this by being ahead of where you think you should be.
- Put in a little extra every day (1 or 2 hours on a long project, or finish a few more small tasks) to stay on top of the sprint.
- Another important thing of course if to underpromise. It's difficult, but don't promise and then do it anyway if you have the time. (Underpromise and overdeliver)
- The downsides of having too much work clogged in the end is immense. You do poor work, you're not thorough, you don't get time to fix small bugs or think of ways to improving it.
- Humans tend to be bad at taking their future emotions/personality into account when taking decisions (under visceral conditions). This is called <77218c05?cf>
