# Core Data: advanced topics

fault: a placeholder object representing a managed object that hasn't been fully realized.
These allow to put a boundary on the object graph. Consider an Employee which has a relationship with the Department. If you load an Employee object, it has to in turn retrieve the Department (which might again have relationship with Employees), causing a single retrieval to load many things. Instead, the Department is represented by a fault, meaning it's instance variables haven't been loaded from the persistence store.


### uniquing
Uniquing ensures that a single managed object per record per context is present. Each managed object context represents a different view of the data. The objects in different contexts may be different for the same record.   
It's the role of core data architecture to detect and resolve these conflicts at the runtime.


### concurrent core data setup

- never use managed object context from a thread other than from which it was initialized. You can use the `perform*` APIs to ensure that.
- never use managed objects from a queue other than that which is managed by its owning context. Use `object(withId:)` api to create a managed object for another context.

#### debugging concurrency
add `-com.apple.CoreData.ConcurrencyDebug 1` in "Arguments Passed on Launch" in the run scheme of the app target.
