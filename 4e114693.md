# App Development

## Mindset

- Use the app. Scan it. It's okay to want the app to be pixel perfect.
- Mobile apps is a wide enough segment to master presently - iOS, android, flutter, react native, branch, firebase, and so on.
- Residing purely on the tech can only take you so far. Understand the business.
- What are the most important problems in this project?
- If you were the sole person working on this product, can you do it? Do you understand the design and business implications? How does the world look from the eyes of Design or Product team?
- The more you free up people above you, the more your plate gets filled, the more you can delegate down (and allow people to take more responsibility and grow).
