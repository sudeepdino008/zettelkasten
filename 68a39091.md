# (Avoid) Snacking

- `Snack` is low impact, easy tasks.
- Snacking also includes being fuzzy about your work - not thinking of ways to do your job better or quicker, but just going along with being busy, letting work expand and fill up your time.
- It gives a sense of accomplishment, as you tick off items from your todo list.
- You might not learn a lot from it. Furthermore, it might actually have been a good opportunity for someone with less experience.
- It's okay to snack a bit to keep yourself motivated between bigger accomplishments, but you gotta be honest about how much time you are spending on it.
