# removing DRM from Kindle
DRM is evil. I cannot sleep at night knowing that my ebooks can be revoked anytime due to some arbitrariness from amazon, or if amazon goes bust in a bunch of years. I want to own my ebooks, rather than have a "privileged right to lend and read it".

Using this [DRM removal tutorial](https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/calibre-kfx-drm-guide.html)

- We'll use the [DeDRM plugin](https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools). It currently only works for [Calibre 4.23](https://download.calibre-ebook.com/4.23.0/). So if you have Calibre 5 and above, delete and install 4.23.
- Download Kindle Mac app 1.26
