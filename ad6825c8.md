# bash loops

### writing loops in a single line

sample bash loop
```bash
for i in {0..50}; do
    git show HEAD~$i | grep "TO-SEARCH"
done

```

You can also write it in a single line:

```bash
for i in {0..50}; do; git show HEAD~$i | grep "TO-SEARCH"; done
```

* seems like commands are separated either by `;` or a newline

### going through list of items

```bash
export devices="701 702 801 802"
for device in $devices; do
    echo $device
    echo "hello\n"
done
```


### loop through all files in a directory (recursively)

We rely on `find ./` which returns all files/folders in a directory
```bash
for file in `find ./`; do
    echo "just printing" $file
done
```
