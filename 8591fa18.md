# Rust: Generic types, traits and lifetimes


## generic types

- using generic types in function prototype 
- this example includes trait bounds: `<T: PartialOrdering>`
```
// in function
fn largest<T: PartialOrdering>(list: &[T]) -> T

// in struct
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

// in method definitions
impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}

// in enum definitions
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}

```

- To implements generics by *monomorphization* of code, which generates various concrete types as need at compile time (similar to c++ templates). Hence generic types have no runtime costs.


## traits
- defining shared behaviour. Similar to *interfaces* in other languages although with some differences (??)

```rust
//defining a trait
trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
    
    // default implementation
    fn summarize2(&self) -> String {
        String::from("useless summary here")
    }
}


// implementing a trait
impl <trait-name> for <struct-name> {
    <body>
}

// default implementations


```

- when implementing a trait, note that either the trait or the struct should be internal (belong to you). Without this rule two crates could implement the same trait for the same type, and Rust couldn't know which impl to use.


- traits as parameters and return type: trait bound (has more expressibility) and impl trait (simpler in some cases)

```rust

// impl trait syntax
fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
    //blahblah
}

// trait bound syntax
fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
    //same blahbha
}

// for multiple traits
fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {}

fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {}


```

- `where` clauses: for cases where too many generics and trait bounds are involved.

```rust

fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 
    where T: Display + Clone,
          U: Clone + Debug
{
  //..
}

```

- However, you can only use impl Trait if you're returning a single type. For example, this code that returns either a NewsArticle or a Tweet with the return type specified as impl Summary wouldn't work:
```rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}

pub struct NewsArticle {}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {}
}

pub struct Tweet {}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {}
}

fn returns_summarizable(switch: bool) -> impl Summary {
    if switch {
        NewsArticle {}
    } else {
        Tweet {}
    }
}

```


- conditionally implement methods with trait bounds

```rust
// here special_func is only available for structs which are associated 
// with T which is trait bound by trait1 and trait2
impl<T: trait1 + trait2> StructName<T> {
    fn special_func() {}
}

// blanket implementations: conditionally implement a trait for type which implements another trait
impl<T: Display> ToString for T {

}

```
