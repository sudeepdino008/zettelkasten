# Rust: Generic types, traits and lifetimes


## generic types

- using generic types in function prototype 
- this example includes trait bounds: `<T: PartialOrdering>`
```
// in function
fn largest<T: PartialOrdering>(list: &[T]) -> T

// in struct
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

// in method definitions
impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}

// in enum definitions
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}

```

- To implements generics by *monomorphization* of code, which generates various concrete types as need at compile time (similar to c++ templates). Hence generic types have no runtime costs.


## traits
- defining shared behaviour. Similar to *interfaces* in other languages although with some differences (??)

```rust
//defining a trait
trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
    
    // default implementation
    fn summarize2(&self) -> String {
        String::from("useless summary here")
    }
}


// implementing a trait
impl <trait-name> for <struct-name> {
    <body>
}

// default implementations


```

- when implementing a trait, note that either the trait or the struct should be internal (belong to you). Without this rule two crates could implement the same trait for the same type, and Rust couldn't know which impl to use.


- traits as parameters and return type: trait bound (has more expressibility) and impl trait (simpler in some cases)

```rust

// impl trait syntax
fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
    //blahblah
}

// trait bound syntax
fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
    //same blahbha
}

// for multiple traits
fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {}

fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {}


```

- `where` clauses: for cases where too many generics and trait bounds are involved.

```rust

fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 
    where T: Display + Clone,
          U: Clone + Debug
{
  //..
}

```

- However, you can only use impl Trait if you're returning a single type. For example, this code that returns either a NewsArticle or a Tweet with the return type specified as impl Summary wouldn't work:
```rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}

pub struct NewsArticle {}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {}
}

pub struct Tweet {}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {}
}

fn returns_summarizable(switch: bool) -> impl Summary {
    if switch {
        NewsArticle {}
    } else {
        Tweet {}
    }
}

```


- conditionally implement methods with trait bounds

```rust
// here special_func is only available for structs which are associated 
// with T which is trait bound by trait1 and trait2
impl<T: trait1 + trait2> StructName<T> {
    fn special_func() {}
}

// blanket implementations: conditionally implement a trait 
// for type which implements another trait
impl<T: Display> ToString for T {

}

```


## lifetimes


- it's about connecting the lifetime (scope is another way to think about it) of various parameters. Lifetimes are a type of generic

```rust
fn lifetime() {
    let str1 = String::from("GG");
    let str2 = String::from("wassup");
    let lar_str = largest_str(&str1, &str2);
    println!("largest string is {}", lar_str);
}

fn largest_str<'a>(str1: &'a str, str2: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if str1.len() > str2.len() {
        str1
    } else {
        str2
    }
}

```

- when structs need to hold references, we've to specify lifetimes

```rust
struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    part: &'a str,
}
```

### [lifetime elision](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html#lifetime-elision)

- there are some predictable lifetime patterns in lifetime which have been programmed into the compiler's code so the borrow checker can infer the lifetimes in these situations and won't need explicity annotations. These are called **lifetime elision rules**.
- In case lifetime elision are not good enough to identify the lifetime of some parameter, the compiler throws error.

- input lifetimes: lifetimes on function or method parameters  
output lifetimes: lifetimes on return values.

- There are 3 rules that apply to `fn` definitions as well as impl blocks.
  1. each parameter gets its own lifetime parameter.
  2. if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: `fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32`
  3. if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is `&self` or `&mut self` because this is a method, the lifetime of `self` is assigned to all output lifetime parameters.


- static lifetime: the reference you've specified *can* live for the entire lifetime of your program. But it's possible that it doesn't:
```rust
let x: &`static i32`
```
