# Things which circle back

- There are things which you can't ignore - doing taxes  or visiting your doctor.
- These things are chore, often boring and doesn't get you excited at all, and it's easy to procrastinate it and deal with it later.
- When it's easy to form a tendency to keep doing this. This is sub-optimal : These are responsibilities, and unless you are planning to run-off to Himalayas, these will circle back to you.
- It's better to notice when you are getting lazy about them, and deal with it then and there.
