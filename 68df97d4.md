# Custom URL Scheme in iOS

- Provides a way to reference resources inside your app. Users tapping on a custom email for example, can launch the app in a specified context. It can also launch app in a specific context data, like a photo libbrary app might display a specified image.

- You can enable it from `Info tab -> URL Types`
- If the url scheme provided is `MYAPP` for example, you can go to browser and type `MYAPP://` and it should open the app. There can be data passed to it as well.

- It's an acceptable kind of deep linking (??), employed by [Branch](https://branch.io/)
- There are some common schemes for system apps, like `mailto`, `sms`, `tel` and `facetime`
- custom schemes offer a potential attack route into the app. Make sure you allow few operations, validate the urls, and don't allow sensitive operations like delete.

- Universal links(??) are more strongly recommended.
