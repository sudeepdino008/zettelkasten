# Haskell: Syntax in Functions


- Pattern matching- define different behaviors for a function on different inputs [base conditions first- Order is important!]:

```haskell
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n-1)

head :: [a] -> a
head [] = error "can't call head for empty list :("
head (x,_) = x

first_msg :: [a] -> String
first_msg [] = error "can't get first for empty list"
first_msg complete_list@(first_elem:_) = "the first element of" ++ complete_list ++ " is " ++ first_elem
```
Pattern matching allows you to match the argument to some defined form, and have a way to deconstruct it.  
Also, pattern matching would work great with recursions.


- Guards, guards!
```haskell
remainingTime age
  | age < 50               = 70
  | age >= 50 && age <= 70 = 50 + (70-age)*2
  | otherwise              = age + fromIntegral(round(age**0.5))
```

- `Where clauses`, `let in`
```haskell
calcBmis whs = [ bmi weight height | (weight, height) <- whs]
  where bmi weight height = (weight/height^2)


bmi w h = val
  where sq = h * h
        val = w / sq

-- nested where clauses (child 'where' definitions are only available to parent where and not to grandparent and above)

bmi w h = val
  where val = w / sq
        where sq = h * h
        
-- let bindings
-- let <bindings> in <expression>


cylinder r h =
  let sideArea = 2 * pi * r *h
      topArea = pi * r ^ 2
      in sideArea + 2 * topArea
      
sq3 = let square x = x*x; cube x = x*x*x; quad x=x*x*x*x in [square 1, cube 2, quad 3]

```

`let` bindings are expressions themselves, `where` bindings are just syntactic constructs.  
`where` bindings come at the end of the function, making the function possibly neater.



- A syntactic sugar over pattern matching on function definitions is **case expressions**
```haskell
-- case expression of pattern -> result
--                   pattern -> result
--                   ....


head :: [a] -> a
head [] = error "no head bro!"
head (x:_) = x

-- using case expression

head :: [a] -> a
head xs = case xs of [] -> error "no head"
                     (x:_) -> x
                     
describeList2  xs = "The List is " ++
  case xs of [] -> "empty"
             [x] -> "a singleton list."
             _ -> "a longer list"


```

Not only is meant as a syntactic sugar over function definition patter matching, but it can be used anywhere since it's an expression.
