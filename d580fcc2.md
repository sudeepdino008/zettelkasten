# Incremental Improvement

- Creative bouts of brilliance seldom works for me (or anyone so far as I know). 
- Yet we romanticize the notion of epiphany and so called tail-events.
- Such creative flashes might as well occur, but it's not within your control. What's in your control is to immerse yourself in the needed field, to <0d3bb863>, such that your mind is ripe for a eureka moment to pop up.
- Even if such a Eureka moment doesn't pop up, incrementally improving yourself leads to amazing improvements because of  <63047192>.


## Bias
It's easy to work in a diluted way every day and think that you're doing ok, and in long term you'll catch up. There's some truth to that, but it's easy to get complacent (<436fc2d3>) and lose intensity in your regular practice because you know you'll do it everyday.
