# Domain Name System (DNS)

[Definitions](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8499#page-46):

- Naming system: associates name with data  
- domain name: an ordered list of one of more labels.  
- composition of names: The length of each label is between 0 and 63 octets inclusive. The last label has 0 octets (The "root" label) and is the only label that can have 0 octet length.  
In some RFCs, the domain name is often represented as a graph with the labels as node. The domain name can be fully-qualified if the last label identifie the root of the graph. Other domain names whose labels form a strict prefix of the fully-qualified names are relative to the first omitted node.

- Format of names: wire format (each label is preceded by its length - this helps in keeping away from escaping characters), presentation format(the non-root labels are preceded by a dot. e.g.: "example.tld.") and common display (same as presentation except that the last dot is optional).  
Wire format also helps to save space as the domain name might be repeated throughout the packet. This is done by using "jump directives". [Note that a DNS packet is 512 bytes.]

- Top-level domain (TLD): the zone that is one layer below the root. For example: "com" or "org"

- subdomain: a domain is a subdomain of another domain if it is contained within that domain. For example, in the hostname "nnn.mmm.example.com", both "mmm.example.com" and "nnn.mmm.example.com" are both subdomains of "example.com".

- CNAME: traditionally refers to the owner of a CNAME record (unfortunate).

- RRset: set of resource records (RR) with the same label, class and type, but with different data.

- master file: text files that contains RRs in text form

- resolver: a program that extracts information from name servers in response to client requests.

- stub resolver: a resolver that cannot perform all the resolution itself. It dependes on a recursive resolver to undertake the actual resolution function.

- iterative vs recursive mode: respond back with a referral to another server vs send queries to other server in order to get the final answer. Recursive resolvers would usually cache the answer it receives from the other server (making it a full-service resolver)

priming: the act of finding the list of root servers from a configuration that lists some or all of the ip addresses of the root servers. In order to operate in recursive mode, the resolver needs to know atleast one root server. Priming is most often done from a configuration setting ('root hints file') that contains a list of authoritative servers for the root zone.

negative caching: "the storage of knowledge that something does not exist, cannot or does not give an answer."

authoritative server: is one that knows that content of a DNS zone from local knowledge, and thus can answer queries about that zone without needed to query other servers.  
A authoritative-only server will ignore requests for recursion.





Dig - DNS lookup utility is a tool for interrogating DNS name servers.

Netcat (nc)
The nc (or netcat) utility is used for just about anything under the sun involving TCP or UDP.  It can open TCP connections, send UDP packets, listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports, do port scanning, and deal with both IPv4 and IPv6.

 Common uses include:

           o   simple TCP proxies
           o   shell-script based HTTP clients and servers
           o   network daemon testing
           o   a SOCKS or HTTP ProxyCommand for ssh(1)
           o   and much, much more

```bash
nc -u -l 1053     # listen for a UDP connection on localhost 1053
nc -u 8.8.8.8 53    # open a connection which can send commands to 8.8.8.8 port 53
```


hashdump

```bash
# hexdump -C query_packet.txt
00000000  86 2a 01 20 00 01 00 00  00 00 00 00 06 67 6f 6f      |.*. .........goo|

```

each line is 16 bytes, each column is 1 byte.
