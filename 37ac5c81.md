# Questions on compensation

1. who makes decisions about raises; when do we adjust salaries (can it happen in between, what's the process for that?)
2. Does the company actually stick to its salary ranges (what's the range for me? do we make exceptions? who decides when an exception is made)
3. what is the salary range at my level? (Same question for compensation)
4. at higher levels, will my pay mostly be equity? what about bonuses
5. when are equity refreshes given? (yearly or when initial stock grant is about to expire) - who makes decisions on the equity refreshes and how? Are they based on level? performance? who decides?
6. is it possible to take unpaid time off?
